    "title": "Yes, there is a ranked site for Arena - arenarank.lol",
    "selftext": "In February when Arena was announced, we were caught off guard by Riot informing us that there would no longer be player ranking\u2014a move that might have been good for some players who liked that idea, but there were players, like me, who didn\u2019t like it because besides the fun, we also enjoy the competitiveness that surrounds the mode.\n\nSo I decided to create a site back then, and this week it was finally ready (arenarank.lol). However, it\u2019s only available in the Brazil region and I\u2019ll explain why.\n\nThe site works in a very simple way:\n\nRiot provides an API that gives information on players\u2019 matches, the player's elo in other queues, the people they were paired with or against, and the elos of those people.\n\nAfter collecting this data, we have a formula where we define the difficulty of the queue and the placement the player finished in the matches to determine how much PDL the player should receive per game (similar to how MMR works in League of Legends). All players start with 1000 points after registering in the system.\n\nObviously, this is a project that we haven\u2019t had years to develop like the League of Legends ranked system, but the system is very fair and balanced\u2014at least in my view\u2014and of course there is room for improvements that are already being worked on behind the scenes.\n\nUnfortunately, we couldn\u2019t add all the players who play Arena automatically, because that would demand more computational power, something we sadly don\u2019t have the resources for at the moment. This ends up limiting us to the player having to add themselves manually to participate in the system; thus, we filter only those who really want to participate, which saves computational costs for validating and checking these players with our system.\n\nThis solution for Arena ranking took a while but was very well received here, with about 3 days of the system already attracting plenty of players and streamers, and it gave relief to those who had stopped playing Arena due to the lack of competitiveness. I really wanted to scale my project not only for Arena but also for all rotating modes and in all regions; maybe in the future, I\u2019ll work on that!\n\nAnyone with any tips, I\u2019m open to suggestions from the bottom of my heart. I made this site not to gain financial returns, but simply to have my beloved Arena ranked system.\n\n(If you\u2019re a developer and liked the idea and want to bring it to your region, we\u2019ll help you do that and provide you with our code. All for Arena!)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/71wirlbp3vse1.png?width=1516&format=png&auto=webp&s=f375f98ae110cfcae991d80082b7cd453427ce3a\n\n",

    "title": "With us getting news soon. I have been thinking too much about Story Mode so here is a bunch of my speculation thrown out randomly.",
    "selftext": "**Chapter 2**: With us having Chapter 1 already as a point of reference, Chapter 2 is the easiest to speculate on. What we can tell already is that it is in this chapter most likely that we will recruit Shinohara, Kameo (Shelby) and Shisendou (Fontaine) into Nagumohara (South Cirrus) as a team. \n\nAnd this is my first guess: *Shisendou will be a major focus in particular*, as the student council president, he has the authority to interfere with Unmei (Destin) in his formation of the football club, meaning that him finally joining could be presented in the story as the moment the football club can finally become official. And as one of the first three characters revealed for the game since years ago, it is safe to assume he will be one of the more important members of the team. I expect him to be somewhat like Sakurazaki (Briar) in Chapter 1, a character introduced at the start of the chapter and who it takes all the way until the end of the chapter to be convinced to join the team. \n\nAnd with the end of the chapter brought up, this is where I make my other prediction: *The climax of Chapter 2 will be the first football battle in Story Mode*, and in particular, *that it will be a homage to IE1*, after Shisendou, Shinohara and Kameo are all recruited and the team is officially formed (Albeit incomplete still), they will come upon Yagyuu (Thierry), who will definitely remember what Sakurazaki did in Chapter 1, and will, with quite the grudge, not be very willing to let the football team use the school pitch to train.\n\n**Gameplay Systems in Story Mode**: When it comes to Competition Routes and Scouting, all that we have seen so far has been gameplay of Chronicle Mode and nothing on Story Mode, so it begs the question: Will such systems be there in Story Mode?\n\nAnd here is my guess: *There will be no Competition Routes in Story Mode*, instead, the game will bring back something from IE1, not the European version of IE1, but the Japanese version. In that original version, there were no Competition Routes, and instead, you asked for Aki to arrange rematches with teams you already defeated once. I expect Victory Road to have a similar system of a character arranging rematches for the player, albeit more robust, and also that these rematches will be where the difficulty selection will come into play in Story Mode (As they said in a blog spot that matches in Story Mode also have different difficulty settings, and this could be how).\n\nAs for Scouting, I think once again, IE1 will be the point of reference. While Chronicle Mode seems to use its own system, I think Story Mode will have a system like IE1 in that there will be a specific NPC (Or NPCs) that assists the player in Scouting. And the act of Scouting itself will be less about getting items or fulfilling specific criteria and moreso about just finding the player you want to scout in the first place.\n\n**Soramiya Sei (Nikas)**: Soramiya was introduced in the demo, and for a character who would seemingly just be a basic player of a Regionals rival team, there has been a lot of emphasis on him. He appears in one of the visuals you can unlock from the demo, his team is coached by a legacy character, his team get to the finals of the Spring Cup Nationals and face Raimon. It all seems like too much for a character who will apparently not even be the Regionals final boss (As we already know Toufu Ikkokukan (Eastwind) will take that role). So here is my bold prediction: *Soramiya will be a mid-addition to Nagumohara like Kidou in IE1*, now, we already know Nagumohara will have one team addition in Yagyuu already, but I think both will be team additions, just at different points, Yagyuu joining the football team at some point during the Regionals round and Soramiya at some point during the Nationals.\n\n**The Raimon Coach**: Victory Road so far has only teased a standard sports series tournament plot. And I do think it could just be that indeed, a straightforward tournament with no twists that make the stakes higher than that. But **if**, and I mean **if**, the plot decides to have some kind of villain character of some sort, the Raimon coach will 100% be the guy. If this happens I doubt it will be something that will like, overtake or consume the story or anything like the Fifth Sector plot in GO, that it will, at most, be as important as the Gekkou Electronics plot in Ares.\n\n**Alice**: My most minor prediction. But my guess is that this weird character who appears at the end of PV7 will be a character along the same vein of Fubuki (Shawn) in IE2 or Ichihoshi (Lucas) in Orion. A character whose sibling passed away a long timme ago and now sufers from some kind of personal identity-related problem because of it.\n\nWhat are you guys' theories or expectations for Story Mode?",

    "selftext": "Hi All,\n\nI live in a 5 bed HMO in England\n\nThe property is advertised as having a cleaner one per week, which I have screenshots to prove.\n\nUpon moving in I discovered from my housemates that the cleaner is in fact that landlord.\n\nI initially had no problem with this however - she has been coming to the property almost daily and does not give any form of notice to any of the tenants nor follow/communicate any form of schedule as to when she will be coming to \u201cclean\u201d or to do viewings for prospective tenants.\n\nI\u2019ve read about the right to peaceful enjoyment etc but I\u2019d just like to know where we stand?\n\nAt present we\u2019re getting messages regarding our shoes being left by the door (on a shoe rack), the placement of the toaster in the communal kitchen and generally feel somewhat harassed by the fact that on any given day we could walk into the kitchen to find her mucking about with who knows what. \n\nI\u2019d love to know how we can address this with her as all of the housemates have NO problem with her cleaning (once weekly as per the advertisement) but the fact that\u2019s she\u2019s constantly in what technically is our space is starting to irritate everyone.\n\n - is the landlord allowed to not disclose that they are in fact the \u201ccleaner\u201d?\n- are they allowed to arrive whenever they please without notifying us? Regardless of the purpose (viewings,cleaning and what feels like snooping) or do they have to adhere to a cleaning schedule or inform us that they will be arriving? (24hrs notice etc.)\n\nI\u2019ve never lived in an HMO before and was always a private tenant and my agents/landlords would ALWAYS give 24hours notice of their arrival, regardless of what the purpose was (maintenance, viewings etc).\n\nTo add to this last weekend we received a message out of the blue late on Saturday saying that the plumber (whom she let in as none of us had any idea there was an appointment scheduled or any issue to be dealt with) had found a \u201cmajor high pressure leak\u201d (read as drip of max 10ml a day) and therefore our water would be off for the next 24hours?\n\nMy issue, and that of my housemates is that we\u2019re not lodgers, this is (I think) technically our space and she therefore cannot just arrive and let herself in as she pleases. \n\nIn addition to this the fact that she flat out lied to my face and \u201ca cleaner comes\u201d to clean communal areas weekly turned out to be the landlord herself puts a bad taste in my mouth.\n\nAny advice or insights would be appreciated!\n\nThanks!",

This is one of my worst fears come true; even though nobody has directly said i stink, all of these complains about the smell of somewhere or something I\u2019m not able to smell has me going crazy.I try to do everything perfect too.I use body scrub,body wash, Cetraben as cream, body mist and perfume as well as some deoderant on the inside of my shirts.A good day for me is when nobody complains about a smell I can\u2019t smell.And i want to change that, i just want to be happy and well, nice smelling? If I even do stink that is. Any advice would be really helpful, especially if someone has gone through something similar!",

    "title": "Jornay PM just changed my life",
    "selftext": "I was recently diagnosed last fall (at 34 years old), and have been doing the usual guess work with finding the right meds/dosage. I've always REALLY struggled with mornings, and even on meds, I was having such a hard time. I would wake up groggy, feeling like I was trying to swim through molasses. I had to set my alarm for 1.5-2 hours prior to when I actually needed to get out of bed just so I could have time to wake up. I also have hypothyroidism, so I have to take my Synthroid first thing in the morning, separate from my antidepressants. Having to wait at least an hour before taking the rest of my meds usually resulted in me forgetting them entirely. (I tried setting an earlier alarm to wake up and take the Synthroid and then go back to sleep, but that was unsustainable. It was always like my sleep cycle got reset and the handful of hours I slept beforehand no longer counted.)\n\nI was also finding myself absolutely exhausted by about 4 PM, and adding an afternoon dose of stims was difficult for me to remember. Eventually my psychiatrist put me on Vyvanse, which seemed to make a big difference over the ritalin/adderal as far as longevity, but I was still struggling in the morning. So I started Jornay PM 40 mg about a week ago. (For those unfamiliar, Jornay is taken at bedtime, rather than in the morning.)\n\nThe difference has been UNREAL. I wake up feeling alert and ready to take on the day. I even feel REFRESHED, which hasn't happened.... ever. I haven't needed to lay in bed on my phone for hours before getting up, I don't feel physically exhausted just getting downstairs anymore. I can get right into work and be focused and productive for the ENTIRE DAY (which is very helpful as right now I'm doing the job of three people - I work in state government). Last weekend, even if I sat down for a few minutes, I no longer felt glued to the couch and could just get up and do other things.\n\nLast night I increased my dosage to 80 mg and this morning I feel like a totally different person. My fiance was actually a little annoyed at the energy I had and how I was ready to just get up and GO GO GO when he wanted to sleep in lol\n\nI know there's a good chance that I'm just riding the \"new med high\" and my energy may lessen as time goes on and my body gets more used to the drug, but so far I'm feeling so optimistic. I still have a lot of hurdles to overcome (depression/anxiety and possibly high-functioning autism with the ADHD really make for a tough time), but things don't seem quite so bleak for once.\n\nWhat are your experiences with Jornay PM? Did anyone else experience such a stark contrast? Did you experience any issues that may not have shown up at first? I'm very interested in hearing other people's stories!",

    "title": "I (18F) feel like I ruined my relationship with my bf (19M) forever. Can it be saved?",
    "selftext": "TW: self harm, anxiety, depression\n\n1 year long relationship. So we are currently in a ldr but we've met irl and the relationship went super great so far, we were really unseparable and super super super close to each other and we had an unbeatable connection. We used to speak every single day and text each other good night paragraphs every time before we went to sleep. It was all going great, until 2 months ago.\n\nFor some reason I felt like he isn't doing as many efforts as in the beginning partly because of his financial situation and I tried to speak to him about it and I asked him if he is getting bored of me. By example the 3rd time when we were irl he didn't buy me flowers although he promised me to (he knows flowers mean a lot to me) (and also he got them for me the other 2 times) and idk it really hurt me and I felt like he is just speaking empty words. And another big mistake I admit I did was the fact that he was about to come visit me for my 18th birthday and he asked what gift I want and I wanted a 150$ gold bracelet and he asked me \"does it really have to be gold?\" and I was like \"uhh i would prefer it because it doesn't go black but if you can't afford it you can get me a lipstick\" and I sent him some affordable lipstick options because he was broke at the time. He apparently wanted to get me a 40\u20ac bracelet but I usually only wear gold jewellery and I refused and I would've rather he got me something more in the price range. He also wanted to impress my family with a great gift and I suggested something to him. I wanted to make him feel better about it and I was like \"lIl buy the bracelet myself and we will say you bought it, and when you have money you will give it back to me if u wanna, but no rush and no worries\". Also what bothered me is that he said \"if this was me 2 years ago, i would've done anything to get it for you\" and idk it made me feel unloved. Maybe I was wrong, but thinking of it now, goddamn, i realized it too late about how shitty this was of me and it must've broke him so bad and I'm so fucking sorry Idfk what was wrong with me. Also when he was irl we had to pay our own food and we used to save so much money because he was staying like 11 days and we always limited ourselves and had to count every penny (and that made me really stressed and overthink). He already works one job but the pay is shitty and it is barely enough for us. Back when he visited for the 1st time, he got a 2nd job before he came to me so he can save more, then he got tired of it and quit (which also made me question the efforts). Maybe it's stupid of me but I'm really insecure about this money thing, I'm always stressed when we don't have enough. We also had to take the bus and it was EXHAUSTING because we couldn't afford a taxi. We were both annoyed and stressed because of this. \n\nAnd so yes, I spoke to him when it all ended and he was back in his country. He got really insecure because of this and he started to tell me that I don't appreciate his efforts enough, like the fact he comes to visit me. (I do, but I hate being under stress because of this money situation). I asked him if he would like to work his 2nd job again and I feel like he really hated me for this, then I told him 47392003 times that he doesn't have to and I care about his mental health more than money so if he's exhausted from it then he shouldn't, well yet he still did. It turned into a huge argument and he started to run away (and it's not the first time) instead of speaking to me about it and I got pissed at him and told him something like \"I feel like i'm the man of the relationship because i always have to make you come back so we can speak\". He went bollocks over this and told me I \"called him a woman\" and that I hit his biggest insecurity and also he is super insecure about being called broke (which i didn't?) and apparently I hit his \"weakest spot\". And somehow he correlated these things with me being the man and him not having enough money (although they're different, i called myself the man because of the way we solve arguments, not because I'm the breadwinner). After that argument he said some horrible things to me (like that \"he was a normal boy before meeting me and now he is broke because of me\", \"he was only depressed because of me who ruined his mental health because i made him care so much about me\", he said i manipulate him, he started to call me delusional and when i asked why he is offending me he told me to \"take it like a man\", called me immature, broke up with me, then one day later came back and apologised and I took him back because i still loved him. \n\nFast forward 2 months later, we have seen each other irl one more time, he seemed normal, everything was great. We ran pretty low on money but I supported him and told him I have some with me and I could pay for it, but he got stubborn and he took me to his 2nd job that lasted the whole day and made 200 euro. I didn't think about it much, I was happy he did it. On the last day of my stay I found a few chats with a girl he used to e-date that he texted (texted her about playing a game together 2-3 times, complimenting her voice even though he knew i was insecure about mine, telling her he likes the way she behaves, and other hurtful shit that was like micro-cheating?) when we were in a relationship and it broke me, I confronted him and he apologised and cried and he said it was because we argued and although I was mad af, I still forgave him. Then after I went back to my country, things changed because he started to work his 2nd job again.\nHe became a whole lot colder; more distant and I'm a really clingy person and I wanted to spend time with him and I asked him to quit it and stick to his 1st job because i really missed him and our old relationship. Then he brought up how \"i wanted this\" and i \"made him insecure af and now he's working 24/7 like a real man\" and that he will buy me an iphone 16 bla bla. BUT I DONT NEED THAT, maybe i realized it too late, but actually i just needed his time and affection and i realized my prior mistake and i apologised to him 1 million times and begged him for a 2nd chance. he started to tell me he is \"like a 50 year old husband who hates coming home because of his wife\" , that \"i wont stop fucking his head\" and i'm overreacting, dramatic and its not that deep, but my mistake was eating me inside out. his coldness started to overwhelm me and i begged him to be with me and that i'm about to cut and drink and i need his help, but his answer was only \"okay\" and went to do his job, when in the past he used to help me. i cried and cut so bad my skin split in half, i drank and i vomited for the first time and it was so scary. he ghosted me the whole night and i texted him at 4am with the tiniest bit of hope left in me that he would care, he answered the next morning with \"i cant be responsible for you\". i had like 3 breakdowns and he told me \"eugh, you are so... exhausting\". i begged him to give me another chance in the end and i thought he did, things went pretty well the next week, although i was holding myself back so bad from needing his attention and being clingy, i tried to convince myself it went well with him being absent almost the whole time, but then it happened again. once he came back from work earlier and he promised to spend more time with me and i was so happy, in the end he only had a monologue about how much he loves his car and how his car knows him at his best and at his worst (and idk that really hurt me because i was the one who always helped him and i got him out of his alcoholism and depression and i made him eat again bc he had an eating disorder when we met). then, after promising he would play with me, he told me he wanted to sleep and i told him smth like \"okay i get i wont ever be your priority\" and he got super mad and offended at me for it and he went to sleep on bad terms... it hurt so bad. so bad, because we never did that, we always talked every argument out. it really destroyed me but he still wouldn't quit his job solely because of his insecurity and ego. i wanted him to for this relationship to work and i wanted to be given a chance to talk things out and make him have a break by quitting this job because he always complains about how he can't be there for me because it's exhausting to work 12 hours a day. well he got stubborn and told me i wont get what i want this time and i send him around like a dog, and that i have to support the consequences of my own actions. he also told me i have to suffer from this and couldn't stop blaming me for the mistake i did while i was begging him to quit for the sake of us. he also told me something like \"i wont trust you with this again. i can't believe you wont call me broke\" \"when you cal me broke again, i will take a picture of my money stack and send it to you\" and i felt so humiliated like i'm a stripper he wants to throw money at ? idk. and imo i know i was mistaken but i wanted to fix it so bad, i really did, and in order for this, he has to make the effort of being vulnerable with me again like he was before. but he just doesn't want to, he gets super defensive with me and tells me i want him weak, i want to manipulate and control him, i'm selfish, etc. i told him a real selfish person would make him work to exhaustion and spend all his money in clubs. according to him \"letting him work\" will fix this and make him stop blaming me every day for my mistake.  but i just can't because i want to be with him and i cant and its eating me inside, also i know that he doesn't work bc he wants a better life for us, he works because of his broken ego that he's trying to rebuild. i tried to help him and i wanted one more chance to show him how much i regret it, but he said \"i will work until my confidence builds up again\" and i told him forcing an insecure behavior will only make you more insecure, well he didn't listen. on top of that, i can't bear the fact he is gone the whole day, we barely text, and when he's home, we go to sleep. i miss the attention i used to have from him. and i don't get why this is all so out of a sudden, because he wasn't this way 1 month ago. he treats me like i'm his biggest enemy and he told me \"instead of crying waaa i'm so lonely you should get a grip and be a wife to me and support me when i come exhausted home from work\" and i asked him \"but who supports me?\" and he told me he has it 200492 times harder than me because i've never worked a day in my life and basically my feelings aren't valid and i'm dramatic and overreacting. why is he asking for the housewife treatment from me? it was never this way before. and one week ago when we tried to talk this out one last time he got so angry on call that he started to yell at me. i told him \"yell at me like a real man does , right?\" and hung up. he told me \"provoke me like a real lady does, right?\". i told him i'm tired of this and he told me \"leave me\". i said okay and i broke up. 24 hours later i get a \"i miss u text\" then some short apology with no motivation of change in it. i texted him after 3 days of no contact and he looked idk sad? obviously i was cold because i was hurt and i told him \"this is doomed\". he again got cold asf (even in the arguments he was switching up so fast going from telling me \"i care about you and i will chase you my whole life and i love you the most\" to some more blaming for my mistake) and his answer was \"if you say so\" (no motivation to fix anything, i don't know. i feel like i did everything i could to fix this from my side). i asked him \"you don't?\" and got ghosted. i don't even know what to do anymore. i'm so confused. \nto whoever read this, thank you a lot i really appreciate it",

    "selftext": "Hi all. I made this account a while back to learn about stones through my journey and ask some questions and thought i\u2019d give an update. In october of 2024 i started to show symptoms of my first stone. November er visit confirmed i had a 5.3 mm stone stuck in my right ureter. Surgery was scheduled for January. Right before surgery i passed a sample, dropped it off, and was analyzed to be a calcium stone. From there my surgery was cancelled.\n\nA few weeks pass and the pain was back. Ultrasound didn\u2019t find it but showed hydronephrpsis, so another CT was ordered. CT showed the stone was in the same ureter, now 6mm. Doctors believed it was the same stone and what i passed prior was just a fragment, so i was booked for surgery on this last wednesday.\n\nWednesday comes around and im terrified. Every doctor on the surgery team was emphasizing how likely it was i would need a stent due to how tight my ureter is from holding a stone that long. They gave me all the breakdown and i go into surgery accepting i will be waking up with a stent and likely pain until it\u2019s removed.\n\nGet put under and wake up. First thing i do when i gain consciousness is look under my blanket. I see no string so i ask \u201cno stent?\u201d Nurse replies \u201cno stone!\u201d Somehow, in the week between my CT and surgery, my stone that had grown to 6mm and sat for 6 months, finally decided to pass. Docs double checked my bladder and kidneys to make sure i\u2019m stone free after my last scare.  Everyone involved, myself, family, and the surgical team, are all shocked. \n\nSo here we are 2 days later, finally done with this rock that\u2019s tormented me the past 6/7 months, and i feel amazing. Since there was no stone i almost feel back to normal, just some minor irritation in my kidneys and pain when i urinate but already much less than post op. I just wanted to say thanks to everyone who answered my questions and those who shared their stories that kept me going, this past half year has been brutal but many of you guys inspired me, as i hope this may inspire someone else. \nSTAY STRONG STONERS",

(No hate to the temp. VAs, I just want the VAs I'm used to to return.) Shift Up is not exactly known for [being against using AI.](https://www.reddit.com/r/gachagaming/comments/1e5gnek/shift_up_holds_talk_on_its_usage_of_generative/?rdt=60164) I think using it without consent of the people who fed into the generation is unfair and risking that is not good for any VA.\n\nThe best way I think this could happen is by spending less on the game and affecting Shift Up's wallet. (I know some of you spent early on Bready.) But I'm also not sure how effective this will be considering the small demographic this sub makes up of all Nikke players. Unless this can spread out to other sides.\n\nAnother, funnier way of spreading this sentiment is to vote Crow or some other Nikke in the upcoming Nikke poll. Or maybe talking on Blablalink? Anything to get the idea out there?\n\nI love Shift Up's commitment to fans, but the lack of AI protections make me uneasy about supporting the company by giving money.\n\nWhat do you guys think?",

I\u2019m not sure what to do if I fail. I really want to build things and work in tech but math is such a huge roadblock for me. I\u2019m just scared I\u2019m not going to make it.\n\nI know I could take the Science (PCM) stream but I\u2019m honestly terrified that my weakness in math will stop me from going anywhere with it.

Not in a \u201cthey wear strong perfume\u201d kind of way. I mean, when my skin makes contact with someone else\u2019s, even just for a second, a distinct scent blooms in my mind, always something specific, always something weirdly accurate.\n\nIt\u2019s not like a superpower. It\u2019s not useful at all. If anything, it\u2019s been more of a curse.\n\nThe other day, I accidentally brushed hands with a guy at the grocery store while reaching for a bag of rice. Immediately, peaches. Not artificial peach like candy, but the real thing ripe, soft, sweet. He didn\u2019t look like a peach person, whatever that means. Just some guy in a hoodie. But the smell was so strong in my mind that I felt like I had juice on my hands.\n\nA few weeks ago, I hugged my best friend after not seeing her for months. The second my arms wrapped around her freshly dug soil. Not in a gross way, but in that earthy, grounding smell after it rains. I told her about it, and she laughed, saying she had just started gardening.\n\nIt\u2019s not always pleasant. I shook hands with a coworker once and nearly gagged burnt hair. I have no idea what that meant, and I didn\u2019t ask.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter if the person is wearing perfume or cologne. The smell I get has nothing to do with what they actually should smell like. It\u2019s something deeper, almost like it\u2019s coming from them rather than on them.\n\nI told my mom about this when I was a kid, and she just said I had a \u201cvivid imagination.\u201d I tried to ignore it for years, but I can\u2019t. It happens every single time.\n\nI don\u2019t know what it means. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s psychological, if my brain just assigns scents to people randomly, or if there\u2019s something actually happening that science just hasn\u2019t figured out yet.\n\nI\u2019ve never met anyone else who experiences this.

But still, wouldn't it be better than forcing a single character down every player's throat? \n\n\nIn fact, this would be the perfect opportunity to tweak Companion Missons. I mean, do you even remember the last companion mission? That's how forgettable they are. So, why not actually make it a \"Companion\" mission? Some hints in the main story would be fine, but forcing a single character as some sort of \"canon\" love interest for everyone is not it. \n\n\nSo, what do you think about this? By the way, I thought of this because I just want to be able to romance Aglaea. That emotionless woman needs some love\u2665\ufe0f",

I was in an abusive relationship and got pregnant twice. The first time I told my friend about the abortion but I didn\u2019t tell anyone about the second one that happened a year ago. \n\nWhen my friend got pregnant she asked me for advice on what to do. She purposefully stopped taking bc and didn\u2019t tell the guy and they\u2019ve been together 6 months. I\u2019m angry with her for getting herself and this guy in this situation for one. But I didn\u2019t really give advice and just told her I\u2019d support her no matter what she decided. \n\nWell she decided to keep the baby and I\u2019m having trouble supporting her like I said I would. She keeps sending me pictures of her ultrasounds, talking about how excited her bf is for the baby and each time I smile and celebrate with her only to sob uncontrollably the second I\u2019m alone. \n\nI don\u2019t feel like I can stay close to her throughout this. I guess I didn\u2019t realize I\u2019m still grieving. But I don\u2019t want to be a bad friend. I know this is an exciting time for her and I want to show support but it just feels like I can\u2019t. She doesn\u2019t seem at all aware of the fact that I might have some complicated feelings about this and idk how to even bring up the subject without sounding selfish. Any advice would be helpful.

    "selftext": "[A continuation of my Code Vein HumansAreSpaceOrcs story]\n\n(Galactic Standard=GA, IE=Izlathr emissary, RD=Revenant Diplomat)\n\nIt had been hundreds of galactic standard cycles since humanity had been helped by the Cryolite Archivists. A fair few spacefaring empires coming and going, seeking a way to either extend their lifespans, hoping for immortality or to be able to come back from the dead. Though they give up and die out when learning that the Galactic Community \"banned\" such pursuits. The GC only banned immortality and resurrection through similar or exact means that humanity did achieved it.\n\nAll was peaceful until a new spacefaring empire entered the scene, the Izlathr Dominion. Cryolite studies revealed them to be expert crafters able to recreate something by looking at it. The GC saw great opportunities for bringing back old technology for improved studies. The Izlathr Dominion, however, would only cooperate if they could be given either the secrets of immortality or resurrection or both, as they felt it is, in more polite terms, unfair that humanity gets to hoard their secrets. The Izlathr Dominion's emissary became enraged when the human diplomat said no. This made the human diplomat request a few gs days to be given to prepare a response to the Izlathr Dominion's emissary.\n\nAfter five gs days a different diplomat entered the counsel room. This one seemingly younger the prior human diplomat. To the Izlathr emissary, this looked like the humans were trying to by time, unaware that what stood before them was a revenant much older than all of humanity's population.\n\nRD: I've been told your people want our secrets to immortality and resurrection.\n'The diplomat spoke in an even tone, not letting out an inkling of emotion'\n\nIE: Yes, we believe it to be in the Galaxy's best interest for all secrets to be shared, [redacted Izlathr insult]\n'the emissary ranted, annoyed at having to repeat what they had asked for already'\n\nRD: I'm going to pretend that you didn't just insult me, as a courtesy of your ignorance. Your empire just has to complete a simple challenge \n'The diplomat shot back with a look of a tactician who has already won't\n\nThe rest of the Counsel members that are attending gasped at how easily the revenant diplomat was willing to give up the secrets not knowing how difficult the \"simple challenge\" would be. The Izlathr emissary adopted a smug aura thinking that the Izlathr Dominion's history has made the mighty humanity fold so easily.\n\nRD: you will be allowed to bring any amount of military force to Earth but you can not use any orbital weaponry. The challenge can only be completed by ground troops.\n'the diplomat laid out the first part of the challenge as if it were a walk in the park's\n\nThe rest of the counsel members became even more horrified as Earth had been deemed off limits to all other empires as it's where humanity's revenant population lives. \n\nIE: is that all? Land ground troops on your precious home planet, hah. The Izlathr Dominion will have humanity's secrets in no time. \n'The emissary bellowed with confidence'\n\nRD: Oh landing on the planet id the easy part. The challenge is getting your hands on one of these.\n'The diplomat pulled out a large teardrop shaped object that has white frost leaves on the tip and the bottom and was blood red'\n(See blood beads from Code Vein)\n\nRD: I have allies on Earth. The moment one of your troops meets one of them, they will give that troop one of these. Then the troop must make it back with it. Seems simple enough.\n'The diplomat smiled having set a trap that not even the counsel members were aware of'\n\nIE: HAH! Child's play. We should have that jewel within a gs month.\n'The emissary bellowed as he got up and left the room'\n\nThe counsel members began questioning the revenant diplomat only to be met with one response.\n\nRD: They're going to try and get it legit while having their top crafters try and recreate that which is impossible to create without committing both of humanity's hubris. Then when they eventually try to pass off their fake. That's when I will show them the real reason why we don't want our version of immortality and resurrection to be used\n'the diplomat was cold and confident, knowing full well the horrors that Izlathr Dominion's military is going to face within the Goal of the Red Mist'\n\nIt has been a few gs months since the revenant diplomat and the Izlathr emissary last spoke. They entered the counsel room together. The revenant diplomat staying calm and collected while the Izlathr emissary was beaming with pride and confidence.\n\nIE: Ready to back down. Our troops have found where the revenants hide on earth it's only a matter of time. Let's just skip the challenge and nobody has to lose their life.\n'The emissary spoke as if the Izlathr Dominion had already won'\n\nRD: Challenge isn't over until you procure to \"flag\"\n'the diplomat replied without any hint of worry'\n\nThe challenge waged on, with both the revenant diplomat and Izlathr emissary meeting every gs month. The revenant never showing any signs of worry while the Izlathr seemed to become less and less confident as time went on. Until one gs year later \n\nIE: We have won the challenge.\n'the emissary was proud and confident again as it procured what looked to be a blood bead'\n\nRD: if that is what I think it is, then there is only one last way to verify its authenticity. Bring it over.\n'The diplomat was impress at how close it looked like the real deal'\n\nThe object was brought over by the Izlathr emissary's assistant. Once the object was in the revenant's hands, the revenant did something the Izlathr's weren't expecting. The revenant attempted to bite into the object, failing obviously.\n\nRD: This is a fake.\n'The diplomat's response was short as they smirked'\n\nIE: IT IS NOT FAKE YOU CHEATING [redacted Izlathr curse laden insult]! IT'S THE REAL DEAL\n'The emissary was enraged by the diplomat's audacity'\n\nThe revenant diplomat handed the fake back to the Izlathr assistant before pulling out the actual article.\n\nRD: it fake because I can do this to real ones.\n'The diplomat answer before sinking their fangs into the blood bead and drinking its contents until all that's left is a crystalline shell'\n\nIE: ENOUGH! YOU AUGHT TO SURRENDER YOUR SECRETS AS YOU HAVE MOST LIKELY LOST JUST AS MANY PERSONNEL IF NOT MORE AS WE HAVE!\n\nThe counsel room fell silent. As a holoscreen appeared behind the revenant diplomat. On it was multiple videos pulled from Izlathr military personnel. Showing their arrival, their breach into the Goal of the Red Mist, them fighting horrifying monstrosities time and time again, slowly losing they sanity and their numbers.\n\nRD: Nope have not lost a single revenant since this challenge started. You're troops were killed by what we call the Lost. Blood thirsty monsters that will come back to life no matter what you hit them with. As for how we obtained said footage... We've been fighting them for a few gs centuries.\n'the diplomat replied calmly as if fighting monstrosities that never stay dead is common'\n\nThe Izlathr emissary collapse onto the floor realizing that all this was for naught. The room was silent for what seemed like forever until the Revenant Diplomat spoke, going into detail as to why they forbade the galaxy from using humanity's method for immortality and resurrection. The diplomat elaborated that researching other ways for immortality or resurrection wasn't banned. \n\nIn the following gs years, the Izlathr Dominion, having been humbled by the revenants of humanity, dedicated themselves to researching ways to extend one's lifespan by incorporating research and technology from other members of the Galactic Community.",

The 12v battery recall left me stranded randomly when the auto stop went off and tried to come back on. Called Ford to get it fixed but they said there\u2019s no remedy and since I was out of warranty they couldn\u2019t replace the battery at this time and would have to do a regular diagnosis\u2019s and charge accordingly. Called a few dealers and the answers were all about the same. One did say they would refund it if I bought a battery.  Did some research and everything pointed to a bad battery. \n\nI ended up buying a battery (insane you have to remove the air intake to remove the battery) it fixed the issues, but it just left my wife and I worried about what other issues may come up. We have had about 11 recalls, one bad water pump, breaks beyond loud every time we reverse (recall was supposed to fix this it didn\u2019t, was going to replace them at my next tire rotation) with all these issues and plans of having a family we decided to trade it in for a slightly bigger three row car, a VW Atlas. I just wanted to share our experience. I love ford and have had many over the pass 10 years. I currently have a 2024 F150 and I love it but our bronco journey wasn\u2019t the same. \n\nThe Atlas is day and night compared to the bronco sport. A lot more standard features, we owed $16,400 on the sport got $19,500 for it. It even had some decent hail damage, left the VW dealer with a 2025 Atlas for $35,000, sticker was 42k. We got the bronco sport in 2021 for $31,000 so for us this was a good deal to upgrade to a new car with more features like adaptive cruise, three rows, ventilated seats, and more. They offer 4 year 40k miles warranty and the first three years of oil changes for free standard. \n\nI know this will probably get a lot of didn\u2019t ask comments or why I\u2019m posting this but I wanted to hear how you guys like your bronco and if you have mixed feeling about.

    "selftext": "Hey guys! I am new to the whole horror game genre, though I was too chicken to play them before, turns out I am not, so I am on a binge right now. I've finished TTD and Justine recently and was surprised how well it holds up. Both TDD and Justine were probably the creepiest games I played yet (albeit I only played SH2 remake and Soma), but Justine left me with a bunch of questions.\n\nIt's heavily implied that Justine was psychologically/physically/sexually abused by her father. All of his tests had the \"right\" answer, Justine was punished by not correctly and isolated from her peers. According to her father her personality formed around these tests and she sees life as a series of tests. Why was he testing her in the first place? Does it have something to do with the way she was born?\n\nAt the crypt there is a dug up grave, which, due to his letter next to it, I deducted, belonged to her father , and if you click on it you'll learn that his wife died giving birth to a son. At that moment Justine's breathing begins to sound really masculine and it keeps sounding like that until you leave that grave.\n\nDoes that imply that Justine was originally a male and was later groomed by her father to become a perfect replacement for her mother? I assume, being a psychiatrist who worked closely with other physicians, he had access to various medications that could be used to physically change Justine if she was in fact born male.\n\nAlso, according to her diaries, Justine is implied to be perfectly normal as a child, she was showed to have empathy and care for her friend, Clarice. Even as an adult she speaks to Clarice rather warmly and there is no implication of Justine being abusive to Clarice whatsoever. From her diaries we also learn that the sexual abuse from her father was probably the main cause of her killing him. \n\nIn the final room we have a prisoner (who I assume is her father) hanging upside down with a phonogram tied to his head. So, my interpretation is, Justine is imitating her father, she is basically speaking through him in the final room, and her cabinet of perturbation is her final test to determine if she has any bit of humanity left in her or if she is pure evil by nature, regardless of her upbringing. \n\nAlso, does she hate men? All of her victims are men, there is not a single female victim even though there are women employed at her estate (Clarice). Of course it could be just an oversight or a choice with no particular ties to the plot, there is not enough hard evidence to tie it all together, but her having subconscious resentment towards all the men in her life due to abuse she went through as a child wouldn't be that far fetched.\n\nIdk what to make out of the ending though, my initial interpretation was that by closing the door to the basement and leaving the victims to their demise Justine chose to let that part of her life, including the ghost of her father, behind and start anew. But now I am not so sure of that.",

    "selftext": "So I posted here and on several Facebook  groups for heal on really bad prints I was having. They had weird bumps and really bad layers. It was getting worse and worse to the points prints were an auto failure. The confusing thing was, the bumps seemed to be at an even distance from eachother.\n\nThis might be basic knowledge, im new to FDM, but I every answers I was getting was talking about bad leveling, wet filament, Z Height, etc. All the general problems everyone is usually getting. None of these worked. \n\nUntil it got so bad I could see the Extruder wobbling. Like alot. So i checked online how to fix this, the rare piece of information i got was either \"wobbling is normal\" or just \"tighten the wheels\". None of these worked. I got some people saying: \"Eccentric Nut\". But what the hell is an eccentric nut? Im tighting the wheel bolt and it doesnt seem to work, im just stripping them.\n\nWell well well, i've found this video from Ruiraptor ([HOW TO - Fix Wobble & Adjust the Eccentric Nuts (3DPrinter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GsEdU8ZtI6U) ) that explained it very well and I got it fixed. I was brushing off the video as he doesnt fix a N4Max or similar like I have, turns out its probably similar between all FDM printers.\n\n  \nOn your carriage, you have multiple wheels that hold it in place. But tightening the wheels themselves wont do a thing. Why? because they are set in a metal cylinder and meant to be relatively free to move. What you need to do is play with the eccentric nut: This is a Nut that is typically on 1 or 2 wheels, between the bolt head and the outside nut. This nut being \"Eccentric\" means the hole isnt centered on purpose. So when you tighten it, it moves up and down. This is what pushed the carriage in place. So you play with this until everything is tight (but not too much, the motor should not struggle to move the wheels). The eccentric nut is circled in green in the image and in red is the wrong metal shafts for top wheels.\n\nMy prints were very bad at the end, but when the problem first began it was very subtle. So to anyone having weird walls I would suggest looking into this. \n\nHappy Printing",

If I spend the entire quest using only my main weapon with the other weapon essentially never touched or unsheathed, does it still count the other weapon?

    "selftext": "Backstory time: \n\nWent to an AD within the past couple weeks looking to try on a Longines Zulu with the bracelet, all they had was the strap version which i was more than happy to try. Been wanting a Zulu for some time so getting it on wrist was great to do. After I got done looking at a couple other Longines the gentleman asked me if I would like to check out some other aviation style watches and specifically Breitling. I obliged because I don't frequent AD's enough and why the hell not. I have to say prior to this Breitling had always been \"meh\" to me especially with how saturated they are with those in the aviation community. Nonetheless he handed me the blue Breitling Avenger42 with on the fly micro-adjust and I lowkey fell in love without intending to. \n\nFast forward to this morning as I'm going through my morning routine I stumble across this on eBay with 1hour remaining and a mega reasonable discount even for discount standards. Albeit second hand and probably a bit worn, I'll take a few thousand off retail for something this awesome any day, especially with tariffs coming in hot.   \n\nCant wait to get it in!",

    "selftext": "My fellow SDs and I are, admittedly, horn dogs.  We love pretty girls.  We love sex.  And we especially love sex with pretty girls.\n\nSex with pretty girls can make us do dumb things, like throw away perfectly fine marriage or sell Bitcoin at 10K to fund our SB's new Miata.\n\nWe love sex with pretty girls so much that just the *idea* of it can make us irrational.  And that's how guys get taken advantage of.\n\nWhen a semi-pretty girl is sitting in front of a guy at a M&G, two drinks in, he might start thinking maybe she could be a pretty girl with the right BBL, or maybe sex with a semi-pretty girl is the same.  Spoiler: it's not.\n\nTo avoid bad judgement in my own life, I've taken to jerking off before any first date (kind of like in *There's Something About Mary*).  And wow, what a difference it makes.\n\nIf I were horny, I'd probably rubber stamp 8 out of 10 M&Gs girls and we'd go straight to the penthouse.\n\nBut when I'm relaxed and chill, I get to really test chemistry with the girl, and test whether or not I think sugaring this girl for the next year is going to be worth the quarter of million it'll take to fund allowance, trips, and dinners.  Jerking off is free, ya know?  And so, most sugar dates end with me walking away after meeting a perfectly nice person, but not striking up an arrangement with somebody that's going to have life-changing experiences with me.  Put another way, a girl's got to edge out me and my imagination (and I'm pretty creative).\n\nIn any case, that's my unsolicited advice for this post: masturbate before a M&G and the post-nut clarity will raise your standards at least thrice.",

    "selftext": "I've been a big fan of the show for a while, but I've found that it's gotten harder and harder to rewatch Parks and Recreation in current day. I'll explain what I mean:\n\nWhen it first started airing, we lived in a very different America, even with all its flaws and the recession of 08', the average citizen felt at least some sense of normalcy compared to now. There were plenty of things that the show could poke fun at and parody from real life that we could relate to in some capacity. Even still, when you watched exaggerated versions of real-life occurrences, it made you feel that \"this isn't the norm\" or \"this can't reasonably happen in reality\". However, now it feels that we are living in a worse version of the parody and satire from the show. It would be very hard to make a new season of Parks and Recreation because reality as an American citizen is becoming so dark at this moment in time that it would feel more like a depressing reminder of reality instead of an escape from it.\n\nIf Leslie Knope became a real government worker in the real America today, I imagine even she would struggle to stay hopeful for her country. The bizarre and wacky politics of Pawnee would pale in comparison to how frightening things are becoming here (don't even get me started on what Ron would get up to).\n\nMy main point of all of this is that watching Parks and Recreation has become more of a reminder of how much more stable life in America used to feel (to me at least) and the optimism I and others have  lost along the way. I apologize for being a debbie downer, but I wanted to share this with other fans of this show here because I'm sure at least some of you understand the feeling I'm talking about.\n\nI hope you all are doing well and are enjoying the things that have previously made you happy as much as it used to. Also, no matter what happens here in the US, never forget, when you're here, then you're home.",

    "selftext": "TLDR; My boyfriend (30M) and me (27M) are together for 1+ year and are generally stable. However, he has tendency of saying things about me that are messed up and always apologises with his reasoning being a joke and he is someone with \"low EQ\". The last straw being telling his friends that he does not trust me as he thinks I am a \ud83d\udea9 right in the middle of us purchasing a house. I want to bail but he thinks I am overreacting. Am I?\n\n\n\n\nContext:\n1. Boyfriend (30M) and me (27F) have been together for 1+ year we are overall aligned with our expectations in relationship \n2. We banter alot but there have been instances where his \"banters\" may seem messed up and crossed the line and he blames it on his \"low eq\" and always think i am overreacting as he sees his \"banters\" as a joke\n\nThe last straw:\nWe decided to get a house and During that, we need to decide the house allocation as joint-owners. Most couples usually choose 50-50 (I was in favour of that). However, there are several couples around me who only allocate to 1 owner as it is a strategy to avoid tax if the couple wants to get 2nd property as investment and put it under the 2nd person name. \n\nI brought up the idea casually but he got offended as he sees that I am trying to get the 1st house for myself. He told me that he had a discussion with his friends and he told them in the exact words that \"he would never go for it because he does not trust me and I am a red flag\". He was very proud telling me that and even told him his friends \"cheered\" for him. \n\nI was pissed and said i want to bail on the house and relationship but he said he was just joking and once again blame on his \"low EQ\" as excuse. However, to me, it was not funny even as a joke and I do not want to get in bed with someone who views me that way.\n\nFor people wondering, I have 0 history of cheating, lying and never crossed lines in relationships to warrant this distrust. Plus, he is not even rich so there is nothing to con in the first place.\n\nThere are also several instances where his \"banter\" made me upset but I decided to slide as he is someone who says what he wants to say without thinking. \n1. For example, bad mouthing me to my close girl friends (but he told my friend she could tell me what he told her as he is not guilty), and I believe he would probably shit talk the same things to his own friends if he can even openly share it to my friend that he is not even close to\n2. Comparing me against other \"hotters\" girls asking me why I cannot be like them. He even said everything about my physical is ok except my height. Even says I do not know how to apply makeup like the influencer and should not do it. \n3. Gets super upset buying flowers and gifts for Valentines and birthday - which is the only 2 out of 365 days that I expect him to treat the rest I am open to 50-50. This Valentines, he got upset that the flowers was $100 and got even more upset that I wanted to eat oysters that he was supposed to treat as it was too expensive ",

    "title": "My encounter with the spirit of the apartment, as a helpless little boy.",
    "selftext": "The story I'm about to tell you is told from the best of my recollection. I can't be certain 100% of the story is how I remember it, but I can only be certain it is 100% of what I felt. I was just 4 or 5 years old at the time.\n\n\\*Assume all the dialogue from family is not told in English, but in our native tongue of Bisaya\\*\n\nIn 1999 my family moved into a new apartment. We were an immigrant family consisting of myself, my mom and dad, and my Lola (grandma in most Filipino languages). My parents were both born in the Philippines along with my Lola, and I was born here in the US.\n\nThis was a pretty big deal for my family because it was the first time my parents could afford a place to stay solely on their income. Previously we stayed with my aunt and uncle which did not work well at all. My mom hated my uncle's guts and my uncle hated all of us. My aunt who's my mom's sister was powerless to stop the conflict between her husband and my mom.\n\nThings went well for a while. I started kindergarten and walked to school everyday with my dad. But everytime we walked out of the apartment complex, we saw this ugly looking tree. It was at least 40 or 50 feet high and never seemed to have any leaves. Matter of fact, it didn't have any birds on it like the other trees, and every branch was thick and sharp. It was like lightning bolts scattering out from the tree. It seemed to watch us on our way in and out.\n\nMy dad worked nights at a department store and my mom worked in the day as an architect. So with school, I mostly saw my mom.\n\nOne day, my dad got laid off. Then things slowly took a turn. My parents argued at first. Then arguments became shouting contests, and soon they became violent. I don't know who started it first, but it was ugly.\n\nI once saw while peering out the door of my grandma's room, my parents screaming. My mom threw food at my dad and my dad pushed my mom off of him. The screaming was so loud that a neighbor came to see if things were alright.\n\nLater that night I went to the bathroom and I noticed something was off about the living room. It was dark and quiet, but something felt like there was someone there staring at me. I went to the bathroom, came back to my room, and slept.\n\nThe next evening our family had prayers. We were a devout Roman Catholic family like most Filipinos were, and we had prayers together every other night, praying the Rosary. I was playing with my toys a little louder and my mom grabbed my hands saying, \"WE ARE PRAYING. THE DEVIL WILL GET YOU IF YOU DO NOT PRAY.\" My father lashed out saying. \"Don't talk to him like that, he's only a child.\" My mom said. \"OKAY, FINE! HOW ABOUT YOU GET A JOB THEN AND MAYBE YOU COULD MAKE A GOOD EXAMPLE FOR HIM!\"\n\nAn argument broke out as my Lola tried to calm things down. I ran to my room then my mom grabbed my shorts to sit me down. She yelled in my ear, \"WE ARE PRAYING!.\" My dad grabbed her hand off me and told me to go to my room. My Lola took me and and my mom said, \"YOU ARE ALL LETTING THE DEVIL IN THIS HOUSE. STAY!\" The argument continued.\n\nAs my Lola took me into her room where I usually slept, I saw the tree outside the window. It was as if it was staring into our windwo from across the parking lot. I ignored it and closed my eyes and covered my ears.\n\nAgain, I woke up that night to go to the bathroom with a nasty stomach ache. I was very sleepy but also in pain. Next to me was the bathroom counter made of wood and marble. In the grain of the wood I saw what looked to be a devil with horns and a pitchfork. It stared at me like it was smiling at my pain and a hatred for me. There was no sound and no movement, but I felt it was talking to me. I felt something deep down being said.\n\n\"You're a disgusting little sh\\*t stain you know that? Look at you. Your pants down with your little d\\*ck hanging out. I've seen you playing with it, god don't like that. Where are you going to go, I'm here right next to you. Go ahead and run, you think they'll believe you? I am the spirit of this home and I see you. I'll have a surprise for you you little bastard. Disgusting little trash, you have no Jesus here.\"\n\nI closed my eyes praying the prayer of Saint Michael as my stomach hurt more. I saw for some reasin with my eyes closed, flashing lights that looked just like the devil in the wood. And I felt that same horrible voice.\n\n\"LISTEN TO ME WHEN I TALK TO YOU, YOU PIECE OF SH\\*T! I am the spirit of this place, I will get your mom, and your dad, and your lola, and the little girl in your mommy's belly.\"\n\nA week later my mom announced she was pregnant.\n\nThe fighting between my parents continued and some days they were a loving couple, as though nothing happened. Still, I felt a presence.\n\nAs I walked to school with my dad, the tree seemed to be even more alive. It seemed to stare us down with a hatred no little child could fathom. Some of the branches looked so sharm, it was going to kill me at any moment.\n\nWhen I was being driven home from school in the rain, I felt something tell me to open the car door. For some reason I felt an entity tell me it would be cool to jump out and roll like an action movie hero, even though I knew it was a bad idea. \"But your daddy's here,\" I felt something say. So I unbuckled my seatbelt, opened the door, and my dad grabbed me by my arm, reaching from the driver's seat, screaming at me to stop. I close the door, my dad drags me into the apartment, spanks me, and tells me never to do that again.\n\nMonths go by without anything other than the usual arguing. My mom would later give birth to my baby sister.\n\nWhile my parents were away spending time with I assume their friends, I was with my Lola watching TV. My Lola was praying as usual and then I watched her take my sister out of her cradle. She carried my baby sister when I went to grab more toys from my parent's bedroom, and I watched her go to the front door. She struggled to open the door while holding my baby sister and I watched in confusion. My Lola then turned around and said, \"be a good boy. Please be a good boy.\" Then she put my sister back in her cradle and continued praying.\n\nOn Monday morning, I was eating oatmeal before school while my dad went to shower. My mom walked out of the door after giving me a kiss, and when she closed the door, I noticed something strange about a shelf.\n\nI don't know if it was the sunlight reflecting from the window, but I could have sworn I saw two eyes from behind the shelf. It was staring at me as though trying to get me to stop eating. I ran into my parents room looking for my dad and my dad was there, putting on his clothes for the day. And then behind me was my mom once more. She stared at me and my dad stared at her. More screaming erupts, something about the car, and then my mom grabs my dad by the neck as my dad holds her off.\n\nI saw a strange red discoloration on the doorway. It was almost as if it was blood. I was scared and wet myself.\n\nOn Friday, my parents went out with their friends again and my sister was in the cradle while I was watching cartoons in my Lola's room. A force told me to take out my sister from her cradle, put her on the ground, and jump on her. I felt something control me, take her out, put her on the ground, and I stood above her. I saw fear in my baby sister's eyes until I heard my Lola praying very loudly; she was a scared 80 year-old woman. I got down, picked up my baby sister, put her in the cradle after giving her a kiss, and cried.\n\nThat Sunday, as per tradition for many Filipino families, we bring a priest to bless the house. The Filipino priest throws holy water everywhere and then I see the door to my parent's bedroom stained with blood once more. The priest seemed to notice saying, \"what is that?\"\n\nMy parents had no idea what it was. It became very, very cold and it was 98 degrees outside. I started having an asthma attack and the same angry voice came. \"GET HIM OUT YOU LITTLE SH\\*T. OR I WILL GET YOU. I COMMAND YOU!\" I froze still and held my mom.\n\nOver the next few weeks, everyone was getting sick. My sister and I went to the hospital for asthma. My mom went to the hospital I think because of her diabetes. And my dad broke his arm. My Lola was affected by dizzy spells and seemed to lose her breath a lot. \n\nMy parents despite being Catholic, were very superstitious people. They talked about the strange occurances they had themselves such as missing objects, the ugly tree, and the anger they felt for no reason. A Filipino healer or whatever he was was brought in through a friend of a friend. All of them religious but also superstitious. He camed to be a psychic and a healer. His name was Noly.\n\nNoly said, \"In this house is an evil force. There was a Black family who lived here who was also Christian. The family had many children and they all fought. Some of the children had died in an accident and one of them, the eldest, was a gay young man. His parents did not approve of him and threatened to kick him out. And then he grabbed the gun from his mom's purse and shot himself.\" Noly then went on to say, \"the son tells me to bless this house or get out of it. There is an evil here that is looking to torment the people here.\"\n\nNoly gave my parents a ritual to do where they put symbols of Jesus and the Virgin Mary all throughout the house. It was the Filipino Jesus and the Virgin Mary of course, not that it really mattered I guess. Food was placed around an altar for the \"children here who died including the eldest son, to be given love that they needed. And for the parents to have the food that they had trouble bringing,\" as Noly said.\n\nThe strange occurrences stopped and I stopped feeling the presence of the \"Spirit of the Apartment.\"\n\nThe ugly tree across the parking lot seemed to slowly die until it rotted, and the realtor company (probably) had it cut down.\n\nOur family eventually moved out of the apartment and into our first house.\n\nOnce again, this story is told from the best of my recollection. I had also filled in gaps in my memory, some of them at least, such as the reason for my parent's fighting.\n\nBut as I said before, what I felt telling this story is still 100% the same. I am not religious and I have deep objections to organized religion.\n\nBut I hope and even pray that whoever is staying in that godforsaken apartment, is living in peace.",

    "selftext": "**PSA for my fellow UC warriors, especially those new to the game:**\n\nI recently posted about having a bad UC flare after months of stable calprotectin levels\u2014well, here\u2019s the sequel. And it's not a fun one.\n\nLet\u2019s talk *Flexible Sigmoidoscopy*. If your doctor recommends doing it **without sedation**\u2014I beg you, **don\u2019t listen**. That should\u2019ve been my first red flag. Maybe some people can handle it raw like they're built different, but apparently, I\u2019m not one of those people.\n\nIt was, hands down, the **worst pain** I\u2019ve ever experienced. They had to stop the procedure early because of the amount of pain I was in from the inflammation and trapped gas I had. The camera only made it to the bottom of my sigmoid colon before the doctor had to call it.\n\nSo now, thanks to my stubborn pride (which has since exited my body along with the rest of my dignity and stool), I\u2019m waiting on the biopsy results and have to get a CT scan with contrast to assess how bad the inflammation really is.\n\nBut wait\u2014there\u2019s more! Like any *UC hot girl in 2025*, I landed myself in the **ER the very next day**.\n\nI was sitting at home when I suddenly got severe chest pain, trouble breathing, slight numbness in my left arm, and my heart rate shot up to 160 bpm. I stood up and straight-up **collapsed**. The ER ruled out a heart attack, thankfully. \n\nThe verdict? Turns out it was a combo of stress from the procedure, gas pain, angina, and super low blood sugar. Angina at 29 yrs old\u2014crazy, but so is this whole experience. \n\nAnyway\u2014moral of the story:  \n\ud83d\udc89 **Get sedated.**  \n\ud83e\udde0 **Listen to your body.**  \n\ud83d\udc85 **Anything is possible with UC.**\n\nStay safe out there, fam.

The only reason you had to do that sometimes was to keep your tanks alive. You're usually healing most of your team at the same time.\n\nNow your max healing out put went from 70 per second to 150 persecond. That means you can get a tank back to full health in less than half the time. How would that make you have to healbot more? You won't have to be healbot to keep your tank alive. Go shoot Venom in the face with all this free time. MASSIVE BUFF.\n\nAs for the dash, yeah, that's definitely a nerf, but you will just have to play smarter now. But the main way to use the dash is to get to a wall and run out of there. Just play closer to the walls. This isn't the massive nerf people are saying it is.\n\nAs for the Ult, yeah, I liked the 40 percent damage. But this opens up a lot of possibilities. I'm also a Loki player and could never play with Rocket as we would have no easy access to a survival ult when necessary. Same with Adam Warlock and Jeff. I love playing with a Rocket because I know they will heal me, and I won't have to waste my cooldowns. Especially with all the diving right now.\n\n25% damage is still extremely powerful.

    "title": "8 day Lemosho report",
    "selftext": "Hi all. Here is a detailed report of a trip we did couple of months ago. Hope it helps and feel free to ask anything. \n\nWe were: a team of 5. I\u2019m 35M, 5\u201910\u2019\u2019 (177cm) and roughly 77-80 kg. I run 15 km weekly, and ran a 5-hour marathon couple of months before the climb. My wife is 33, physically small but in good shape as she does advanced yoga daily. Both of us had experience with multi-day high altitudes hikes (Andes, Mexico, Central Asia\u2026) prior to our Kilimanjaro hike. Other 3 members (aged 27 to 40) were all outdoorsy and do some kind of sports (kayaking, running, cycling\u2026) with decent to good hiking experience, but none of us was really an athlete (even an amateur one), just people who like to go out and do physicall stuff.\n\nTime and weather: mid-January this year. Weather forecast wasn\u2019t the best and we left thinking it was gonna be drizzling rain. But it turned out to be pleasently sunny and dry during days 1-7 with less wind than usual. Finding a reliable weather forecast for the mountain isn\u2019t easy so don\u2019t stress too much about it. And then on our last day, while descending in the rainforest, we heard something that sounded like a waterfall in the distance before one of the guides said: \u201cOh no, rain!\u201d. And then it poured for 3 hours non-stop, getting parts of our equipment wet, people slipping and falling on mud, breaking their trekking poles etc. So, be well prepared. Temperature was warm enough on lower altitudes for short sleeves, and cold enough on top for 5 layers on shirts/jackets, 3 layers of pants/legwormers, 2 layers of socks and 2 layers of gloves. Plus a hat and a neckwarmer (or a buff).\n\nTour company: Gladys Adventures. We all chose them because they\u2019re locally owned (used to be female-led but lady Gladys passed away couple of years back and now her son is in charge) and because they\u2019re a member of KPAP. Booking was seamless via e-mail and we didn\u2019t have a single issue from aiport to airport. Price was mid-ranged, 2400 USD per person (cash) + tips. Tips are absolutely laughable comparing to the strenuous work porters do and we left realizing how priviledged our western asses are. In Moshi we stayed at hotel Salinero with breakfast included and had no complaints. Driver took us all for a ride around Moshi on the first day which was really nice. They have a lot of stuff to rent in their office (trekking poles, sleeping bags, jackets, duffle bags\u2026) for about 40 USD a piece or so.\n\nGuides: Beautiful bunch of people that made female part of our team cry when we had to say goodbye to them. Our main guide was Adam (said he has over 100 successful ascents to Uluru and even did it with his little 6 year-old daughter) and Fadhili and John as co-guides. They spoke in great English and were as friendly as they were professional. We were acompanied by about 15+ porters - each of us had a personal porter, two cooks who made two birthday cakes (!) on our last day, tent/camp managers, toilet attendant, waiter and so on. By the time we left we knew them all of them by names, taught them yoga and got cooking classes in return, cramed a 5 person tent with 15 people to play cards and practice Swahili, had 2-3 dance-offs and generaly spent an awsome time. There is a whole ceremony around tipping with speeches and stuff, it\u2019s kinda over-sentimental but nice. Tips are read out loud, probably due to transparency as majority of porters aren\u2019t employed but one time hires living in villages nearby. Also there was a KPAP member in our team (our guides jokingly called him \u201cspy\u201d) and I would skip any tour company that isn\u2019t a part of the organization. Do not at any cost support misstreatment or underpayment of those people to save a few bucks.\n\nSo, would I use Gladys again? Yes, definitely. A safari and possibly Mt. Meru hike are something I\u2019m already looking into for the future.\n\nCamps: Our porters set up all our camps in advance before we arrived. We had a composting toilet and a dinning tent just for the five of us. Tents were for 2, but only my wife and I shared a tent. We're rather small-sized but it felt bit cramped nonetheless. Nights can be freezing and we usually slept in clothes for the next day. Showering isn't a thing on the mountain, sorry. Our camp manager brought us warm water to freshen up in the morning and after the hike. Wi-fi is mostly non-existent although the higher you get the better the chance to get some signal and send your \"I'm alive!\". I didn't bother and enjoyed some blessed time off-grid, and it was glorious. Cooking by our chef was top notch, especially vegetable soups. It was mostly based on chicken and pasta with a fruit dessert. One of the girls in our group was vegetarian, had her own meals, and enjoyed everything. Water was purified and we didn\u2019t use the water filter we took.\n\nHaving our own toilet tent is amazing, as official camp latrines looked truly abysmal and you\u2019re not allowed to do your business in the bush around the camp in order to keep it clean. You\u2019ll pee a lot because you have to drink a lot to avoid altitude sickness, and we were all waking up during the night.\n\nHike: Every day except the last two (midnight summit to Uluru and a long descent to Moshi) was perfectly fine if you have a decent hiking experience. Not too long, not too steep, gradual elevation gain on a pleasant trail with but a few loose rocks here and there. Barranco wall is a lot of fun really, especially if rain doesn\u2019t make it slippery. A detour to a smaller peak is possible if guides get the sense you\u2019re good enough. Every camp we spent the night in had an ever more amazing view of the final goal. I tell you, resting after every day with a view of a grand peak you\u2019re aproaching to is a feeling for a lifetime. It is a quite scenic hike after the initial jungle part, with constant views of the big peak, surrounding meadows and some decent animal sightings (monkeys, birds, hyrax and a deer of sorts). There are always other people and tour groups around you, it\u2019s a busy mountain and January is peak month, but we didn\u2019t mind it one bit. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re gonna get stuck behind (or with) someone at any point or anything.\n\nAll 5 of us started feeling the altitude going up towards Lava Tower (around 3800-4200 m), but then again, some people start to feel it lower and some never do. Our guides\u2019 suggestions on how to maintain good stamina and avoid altitude sickness were valuable. In a nutshell - take it slow (you\u2019ll hear \u201cpole pole\u201d a lot), eat and drink a lot. Our appetites were monitored and our vitals (blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen levels) taken every morning and every evening. We had to report on our number 1\u2019s and 2\u2019s and be honest about how well we feel. They\u2019ll insist you drink water quite often so we were peeing like race horses more than some would prefer.\n\nSummit hike is tough. Probably the toughest day of hiking I ever did. And the reason behind it, for me, was that you don\u2019t have a good night sleep before the start. You arrive at base camp (which is noisy) at around 12 PM. Have lunch, then sleep (t\u2019was a glorious nap for me), then early dinner at 5 PM, then sleep again (which I simply couldn\u2019t do), then a very light dinner before you start your climb at around 11-12 PM on a serpetine in the dark. It was okay at first, we were all pumped, but eventually all of us had smaller to medium issues going up either being sleepy, lightheaded, nauseous, in pain or even vomiting\u2026 It\u2019s also quite cold and can be windy. It wasn\u2019t as snowy as I expected it to be.\n\nBut we also had great guides as around 7-8 summit porters (our guides + some of the porters who are training to be guides) were singing and dancing around us the entire way, rubbing our legs and massaging our shoulders when we stopped, wipping our noses (yes, you read that right\u2026) and even offering to carry all the gear of those who were struggling.\n\nThe moment when you reach the plateau before the peak and sun starts to rise is something I\u2019m not gonna spoil, but tears were heavy and smiles were wide.\n\nAfter a bit of celebration on the top and a tired descent back to the base camp (a girl in our group was carried on shoulders by 2 porters as she just couldn\u2019t even walk after reaching the peak), your guides will tell you to pack your things, have lunch and forgo any idea of resting as there are another 2-4 hours of hiking down to lower camps. Needless to say, we fell on our asses and slept until dinner time once our walk was finally done. The next day is a loooong walk through the jungle (in the mud if rain hits you like it did us) and can be difficult on your knees, but at least you slept. Do not underestimate that very last day!\n\nSo, should you do Lemosho in less days than 8? Sure, 6-7 if you\u2019re well prepared (and budget restrained) is doable. But also, spending as much time possible on the mountain will make you feel more like home and enjoy it to the fullest while minimizing the risk for was is your only and true potential problem \u2013 altitude sickness.\n\nGear: As mentioned, you can rent lot of stuff from the company. My wife and I rented sleeping bags (we had our liners and tour provided camping mattresses). But all of that is stuff left and donated by previous hikers so don\u2019t expect it to be top-notch. Inflatable pillow is a good thing to have, as are ear plugs and sleeping mask. Trekking poles are a must, but for me they\u2019re a must for any hike. Our duffle bags were 80-120 litres (carried by porters), and our day-packs 40 litres (Quechua).\n\nHiking boots Merrell Moab 3 MID, broken-in, served us perfectly. Change your socks and T-shirts daily, and have something comfy to wear and walk around the camp just to feel lighter after a days hike. Flip-flops and regular long sleeve shirt will do. Gaiters are not necessary but recommendable so to keep your shoes dry and avoid getting sand/rocks in them. For the summit hike you\u2019ll need to have a special assortment of clean socks (two pairs), gloves (also two), warm beanie, three layers of pants and leggings and five layers of shirts and jackets. Depending on the snow crampons are a possibility, but we didn\u2019t need them. I would definitely pack some, tho, because in case of high snow you ain\u2019t gonna be allowed to go up without them and that would ruin your trip. I\u2019m a big fan of buffs and have gazzilion of them and recommend everyone to carry a few. Head lamp and waterproof jacket are mandatory and normal pair of sunglasses will be just fine.\n\nAluminium water bottles (2x1,5 L per person) were a great purchase before the trip as they are really light and you\u2019ll have to carry 3 L of water each day. Wife had a shewee but didn\u2019t use it. Little things of great use were dry-bags (one for electronics, one for hygiene products, one for trash, one for medicine, one for travel documents and money, one for this, one for that\u2026), lots of wet wipes and hand sanitizer. Toilet paper was provided to us. Wear sunscreen!\n\nYou\u2019ll get a chance to buy sweets and energy bars in and around Moshi but options are limited. I would stock up back home, especially some energy bars of your preference. Mine saved me during summit hike when I started feeling low blood sugar. One energy bar per person per day was fine because or tour company fed us well, even setting up picnic breaks along the way.\n\nI packed a powerbank (Anker III 10K) and that was enough to keep two smartphones, Garmin watch and a Sony camera running. But again, we didn\u2019t use our phones all that much. Haven\u2019t seen a single drone flying around, pretty sure they\u2019re prohibided.\n\nI\u2019ve read people took swiss army knives, guyline cords and carabiners but I have no idea when and why I would have use them. It\u2019s not necessary for Barranco wall. Climbing helmets also not necessary.\n\nBear in mind you\u2019ll leave some stuff in the tour company\u2019s HQ so bring an extra bag for that.\n\nMedicine: You can buy Diamox for 3 USD back in the town. 4 out of 5 of us used it, some were puking nontheless, I didn't and felt only slightly lightheaded. It's hard to evaluate how much it really does or does not help. We all took Ibuprofen pills when feeling headache due to the altitude and that one I would definitely recommend. \n\nWe also used Malarone anti-malaria pills but I don\u2019t think me and my wife were bitten by a single mosquito, honestly. Nobody had any stomach issues, but do pack some active coal just in case. We didn\u2019t bring first aid kit, guides had those.\n\nPictures: Provided.",

I\u2019ve always been super into technology and I dream of becoming an inventor or working in mechanical engineering.

I\u2019m preparing for my entrance exams and I\u2019m freaking out that I\u2019m not going to pass.

I\u2019m not sure what to do if I fail. I really want to build things and work in tech but math is such a huge roadblock for me.

I feel like there\u2019s not enough time to improve enough before the exam and I\u2019m freaking out. Has anyone else been in a situation like this? Struggling with math but still wanting to go into something like engineering or tech?\n\nAny advice on how I can deal with this fear of failing or any tips to get better at math fast would really mean a lot. I feel like I\u2019m running out of time and don\u2019t know what to do.",

By March, I was back at Heathrow with a suitcase full of bikinis, no job, no car, no home, and no money. COVID had scuppered my American dream. Instead of poolside in Malibu, I was in my sister\u2019s spare room, desperately trying to find reasons not to throw myself off a cliff\u2014or worse, work at Sainsbury\u2019s.\n\nThe truth is, I\u2019d been empty for years before that. Desperately unhappy but too proud to say a word. I\u2019d cringe when people talked about mental health or depression\u2014thought that was for weak people. Not me. I was convinced I could fix whatever was wrong on my own. I wanted so badly to be okay. More than anything, I wanted to go to sleep and never wake up.\n\nIt took getting well to realise just how sick I was.\n\nThe last five years of sobriety have been incredible. I wish I had some cool rockstar story\u2014trashing a hotel, Vegas bender, wrestled into rebab in slow motion kicking and screaming. But the truth is simpler: I just didn\u2019t want to live that miserably anymore. The bravest thing I ever did was stop masking the pain and start healing it. Every day, I count my lucky stars I reached out to a sober director I knew and asked for help. He saved my life. I hope one day I can be that hand for someone else.\n\nI can\u2019t stand preachy sober people. I never talk about sobriety unless someone asks but today is my five-year anniversary, and I wanted to share it. Because depression is a silent killer. I was always the loudest, ballsiest girl in the room\u2014and still, I cried myself to sleep most nights. I wouldn\u2019t wish that kind of sadness on anyone.\n\nThese days, I\u2019m just grateful to still be here. Grateful to be surrounded by people who love me, even on the days I\u2019m not easy to love. I don\u2019t always get it right, but I try\u2014to be kind, to be helpful, to stay passionate. To anyone who may be struggling, or have questions, know that Im a phone call away always. \n\nFive years, baby. Watch what I do with the next five. xxx\n\n",

    "selftext": "After living my whole life very healthy, rarely getting sick and having no food intolerances besides mild and infrequent lactose intolerancy. I have hypothyroidism which can be connected to food sensitivities and was lucky to never have any serious concerns. Having grown up loving to cook and wanting to be a chef I took a bunch of culinary classes in highschool and got a job in the industry. After I graduated I took a year off to work and pay for a reduction. Right before my 4th week of recovery I moved across the country to start culinary school as a baker and follow my dreams. I had a very traumatic first semester with family members passing, going missing, or injured, as well as finding out the night of my grand fathers funeral,  my partner in a serious relationship (ring and all) had been cheating on me the entire time. Shortly after, I started becoming sensitive to wheat/gluten. It started with just some bloating and mild discomfort, and let to cramps and soon debilitating pain. I started to get hives from prolonged contact on my skin, migraines, and making a lot of stupid mistakes and zoning out. I cut wheat/gluten out, eating it on weekends and only thing I really wanted. Once, the pain got worse I would save myself a treat and only on very rare special occasions. While taking my baking internship a year into school I got sent to the ER after a week of crippling pain and not being able to work and decided to switch majors to culinary the next day. At the end of my externship I tried to be tested for celiacs disease and wasn't able to push through a 4th week of gluten a day. And to top it off my tests came back completely normal leaving me back at the beginning. I got tested for multiple things trying to figure out what was wrong. I found out I had GERD and started medication which helped my regular daily nausea, but did nothing for the affect wheat/gluten has on me. A few months later I started my first culinary class and it went well at first until we started using mor flour in our food. I always take precautions and wear a mask, wash my hands and face off often, plastic wrap my arms sealed if needed and wear drift long sleeves under my whites. However I still get sick and end up throwing up during lunch or covered in hives and miserable. It is so discouraging and heartbreaking feeling like your dreams are being ripped away and there's nothing you can do. \n\nSo for any chefs out there with similar experiences, how did you continue? Were you able to? Are you happy now? \n\nI want to go into television or media. I'm an entertainer at heart who loves food. And I want to learn everything I can and truly understand great food and produce it myself. I just feel like I'm at a dead end and want to know if it's worth it or should I start over and change careers?",

    "selftext": "So, to start at the beginning, I worked for free for someone who owned a small business (it was a totally legit business) for over 2 years and was not paid. At the beginning of my 2nd year, the boss said she was going to get me paid that year and officially an employee for the company. I was leg on for months and every time I would bring it up, I was told that she needed to talk to her accountant about it. This job required a lot of traveling, which I did mostly on my own expense. She did pay for a flight and a hotel at one point because I told her I couldn\u2019t afford it, and she wanted me there to work. Several months later, I worked an event that was extremely stressful (not her fault, it was the event planners fault) and I decided to approach things with a different perspective. I instead was going to try to get the third parties we were working with to pay me, and I would give her a cut for her portion of the work as I was doing the immediate bookings and work. She agreed to this, and I booked several events, and then she brought in a different person to help her with the business. I was told that it would be months and months before I was going to get paid, and that we needed to make sure her (the boss) bills were paid first. I was also told that going to the third parties for payment was unethical. To keep this as vague as possible, I will say that I have consulted with at least 4 people i know in this profession, and they all told me this is incorrect; the third party paying for services is actually *exactly* how it is supposed to be done. When I got this email from the new person, I decided to take a step back from things as it was costing me massive amounts of money to work with no compensation, and it was clear that I would be under the thumb and at odds with the new person. Everything quieted down for a bit, and then, last week (almost a year later), a friend sent me a podcast episode that they had put out that was talking about the shift within the company over the last year. It was stated that the boss was the only person who did not get paid, and that anyone who is in this business for reasons other than (what she lists, I won\u2019t say here to maintain some anonymity), is in it for the wrong reasons. The reasons she lists are not even accurate to what I was hoping for from working with this business. \n\nThis has been almost a year. I\u2019ve had no contact with either of them since the original events that lead me to leave. Should I message my old boss and ask her to call so I can put this all to rest? ",

    "title": "I tested a dozen products to fix messy shirt collars - here's what worked",
    "selftext": "Messy collars have always bothered me and for some reason, I hate ironing. I don't know if its the setting up, the weird kinda burning smell, or digging it out of a closet but I'm not a fan. So I set out to test all the different collar products out there to see what could fix collars nice and easy. Below are my thoughts and hopefully I'm not alone about being overly concerned about messy shirt collars. \n\n* Magnetic collar inserts\n   * Wurkin Stiffs is the dominant seller here and I found these worked well - the magnets were strong and stuck to the collar stay all day so the collar was straight without leaving too much room between the shirt and the collar.\n   * Wurkin also makes magnet stays for shirts that don\u2019t have collar stays or that have tie-down buttons underneath. You stick a magnetic sticker on the outside of your shirt and a magnet attached on the inside keeps the collar in place. I found these worked well but I didn\u2019t like having a clear dot on my collar all day.\u00a0\n   * Temu/Amazon sell knockoffs that I did not try. The Temu knockoff was $7 and there is an Amazon listing that just sells some small magnets to use with existing collar stays. Yes they\u2019re cheaper but I prefer supporting the guys who invented these things versus the cheaper knockoffs.\u00a0\n* Slick Collar / Stiff Collar / Perky Collar / collar support band\u00a0\n   * I\u2019m going to call this category the \u201ccollar holder upper\u201d because they all essentially do the same thing. You put a piece of plastic under your shirt collar so it stays propped up all day.\n   * Personally, the Slick Collar worked the best. It was adjustable and had the right amount of firmness to it. It came in three sizes, making it the one of the few that factored in the height of the collar, which varies brand to brand.\u00a0\n   * Perky Collar was the most expensive of the options and was not adjustable so might not be ideal for bigger fellas or bigger shirts. It had the right amount of give but only came in one height.\u00a0\n   * Stiff Collar was the most noticeable of the options I wore because it pokes into your shoulder a bit while the others were more subtle. Stiff Collar comes in different sizes based on the size of your neck size but I own different sizes from different brands so I ended up needing to buy two.\n   * Temu/Amazon sell knockoffs but they are super floppy and only fit one height. You can see that they use a cheap see-through plastic in their photos (the Temu seller even stole photos from the Slick Collar store). Again, I like supporting the guys who invented these things.\u00a0\n* SnapCollar\n   * This is the only product where you don\u2019t actually wear the product and is supposed to replace the iron.\n   * Essentially, put the SnapCollar on a shirt on the night before you need it and the next day, the collar is nice and pressed.\u00a0\n   * The product worked as long as you remember to put it on the night before. If you can get in the habit of putting it on when you hang up your shirt, this is an easy fix.\u00a0\n   * I hate ironing, setting up the board, etc all for one shirt so I can see myself using this in the future.\n   * No knockoffs on Temu/Amazon that I could find\n* Collar stay stickers\n   * These can take a few forms. One option is a one-sided sticker that goes inside the front corner of your collar to stop the corner from curling. It worked well and it was not obvious that the shirt had something on it.\u00a0\n   * There are also two-sided collar \u201cdots\u201d to keep your collar from becoming too spread apart. I liked these less than the one-sided ones because I found curling corners on polos to be my bigger issue. However, if narrower collars is your goal, use this.\u00a0\n* Million Dollar Collar\u00a0\n   * This is the only placket solution I tested. You need to take this to a tailor to insert into the shirt so your placket (essentially where your buttons and button holes on a button up shirt are) is stiff.\u00a0\n   * I wasn\u2019t a huge fan of the look - I felt it flared out and it was clear that something other than sturdy cotton was at play.\u00a0\n   * But I appreciate this is a one-and-done solution. No missing magnets, nothing to take on/off.\u00a0\n   * If the dry cleaner is a hurdle, they do sell shirts with the MDC already installed for $80.\u00a0\n* Collar expander\n   * I\u2019m not citing a brand because from what I could tell, all expanders/extenders come from the same couple manufacturers. These have also been around for years and you probably already own some.\u00a0\n   * I love these - it gave me extra breathing room and was easy to take on/off. I would probably only wear it with a tie or else it looks like your top button is of a different color/kind than the rest of the shirt.\n* Collar pad\n   * Same as the expander - these aren\u2019t new and I have lots of grimey collars that I should have used these on years ago. The pads stayed on all day and I didn\u2019t notice it until I took the shirt off. It was not clear how much the pad absorbed so I didn\u2019t get the satisfaction of a collar well protected but I know if I use them enough, it will do the job.\n   * I didn\u2019t like that the pad fell off each time I took the shirt off. I was hoping to get 2 or 3 wears out of each one so I think these are really a one-time use pad.\u00a0\n   * But if someone knows a pad that lasts multiple wears, link it below.",

    "title": "Strap in for a long story",
    "selftext": "Where do I begin, let's start when I first moved in here. I (27m) moved into a shared living space (sublet) with my two friends (we'll call them Jack & Montey) Jack (54m) & montey (62m). Jack is a gambling addicted alcoholic dishorobaley discharged for drinking while transporting chemical munitions veteran, with sociopathic & manipulative tendencies. On average he burns through around $30 and up a day on online poker, after that it's around $10 and up on scratchers same day, he gets this money from montey and spends the remainder of what hasn't been lost on tall cans of cobra and swisher cigars. If he's not glued to the screen gambling, consuming all the food, or hustling low quality weed on the corner, he becomes flat literally, just a flat person on the couch non verbal and tense.  moved in on the condition that I pay $600 a month, the job I had always paid on the 5th a few days after rent was due, up until around December 13th this year I had rent paid in full at those times, a situation that Montey would come to reference as \"me paying your rent all the goddam time\" despite me paying my share immediately when I had money in hand. During that first year, i pleaded with them to go to bed early, to not be up after midnight playing poker and arguing, because I needed to get up and go to work at 7:30 by bicycle in freezing temps, they never budged for that reasonable request. I adapted so let's move forward, all off a sudden, despite me being the only person working their literal ass off in a horrible little kitchen tucked between two tweaker parks, fighting chronic illness & the pharmacy so I dont die, cleaning up jacks trash and messes, cooking the food etc ... I'm told by Montey & Jack \"you just gotta be cooler man, don't be such a depressed fuck ya know? People have problems...\" In reference to my silence which takes up the majority of my opportunity to let them know what I really think. Montey funds jacks gambling and drinking, essentially enables the bad behaviour and choices, then gets mad when the autistic guy Jack doesn't play poker right, I've seen him (Montey) slam his hands on the desk, throw his head back in frustration while walking away saying \"fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck\" over and over again, more times than I can remember and he still continues to fund the chaos, the cherry on top being a moment sometime ago where he mentioned to me \"we don't have energy for you attitude, were too old man we can't take that kind of energy\" in refrence to me breaking one night and finally yelling at them, here's the thing though how can you not handle my few bouts of justifiable rage when you do it nearly every night? I can't keep up with these guys their habits, the absurd double standards, the little rude remarks like calling my food \"slop\" or \"grule\" when I spent a lot of time and effort assuring my food was adequate, the nature of this place agitates me beyond belief and despite them helping me with rent the last two months, Id almost rather be homeless. Montey has a a little line \"If it's a competition to be the bigger asshole I'll win that one, I'm really competitive I don't wanna be an asshole but I'm really competitive...\" Which is just like wtf? I'm legitimately angry at the amount I do, what I'm facing and how little respect I get out of it, and you think I want to have a completion? Sorry guys thanks for reading I can't even continue describing all the shit this place has thrown at me. ",
