    "selftext": "For the longest time I have always wanted doors closed ,closet doors closed , any door has to be closed if I enter or exit a room it has been like this ever since there was an incident when I was sleeping one night at my parent\u2019s house . I can remember some details but there\u2019s a block that is completely deleted . \n  I woke up at 3:23am I will never forget that detail or the modem or what the cat did. At the time I was just staying with them for a couple weeks while some things got situated . They had this lil couch that unfolded and was like a bed that when unfolded was like a pad sort of on the floor it wasn\u2019t futon style so I was very low to the ground . Their office desk was at the foot of this bed and the modem sat on the floor underneath the desk so it was clearly visible to me. \n  This modem always had this sequence of lights , just like 4 green lil led dots on the front . Like most modems showing it was active , internet was working all that . I remember it had a little pattern flashing just a little bit, but it definitely always was kind of in motion . There was a window behind my head in this particular room . \n    I had brought my cat with me and it was staying in the same room as well sleeping with me . So I wake up and look to my left and see the alarm clock 3:23am and the cat jumps up shortly after I am roused from sleep and walks slowly to the foot of the bed . I am looking down at the foot of the bed and all of a sudden the modem stops flashing , like it stopped in time , the cat arches up looks up towards the back of the room behind my head . Again there is a window there I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s significant or not but I feel like what else would have got its attention alone in a room with me . The cat paused for a moment , it was like motionless frozen in this arch pose. Then almost immediately after this pause , and the modem lights freezing the cat ran across the room it just bolted . Everything stops in my memory at that moment . Until I wake up with sleep paralysis after 5am. I remember my eyes were open but I couldn\u2019t move, I remember trying to scream and nothing was happening . My mind flashed back to that Kill Bill scene \u201c wiggle your big toe \u201c so I just kept trying to do that . It took a few minutes and I finally managed to get up . I still couldn\u2019t make a sound and I can\u2019t recall exactly how I maneuvered but I made it to my parents bedroom door and just knocked as hard as I could . My mom comes out and all I can do is bury my face in her shoulder , I\u2019m shaking and it was like I was trying to scream , and just crying , sobbing with my mouth shut . Tears were streaming down my face , I couldn\u2019t talk , I just whailed not necessarily in pain but I was absolutely terrified . I couldn\u2019t open my mouth for some reason , I couldn\u2019t talk but I could emote that something was terribly wrong . This went on for sometime and then my parents got me back in bed . They just kept telling me I had a night terror , and sleep paralysis is rare but it can happen . But I know what I saw with the modem lights freezing I know the cat saw something because it got spooked and ran from whatever it saw behind me , and then an hour and a half could have been more I know it was after 5am is completely and totally deleted from my mind and we never spoke of it again in my family . \n   Now I get an eerie feeling whenever a door is open in my house especially at night . I just feel like something is going to come around the corner . I halfway wonder if I saw something that night and it\u2019s just created some instinctual keep the door shut reaction . Regardless of if I can remember or not .But again I have no memory for 2 hours of that night but I have had this fear of doors being open ever since . What do you all think happened ?",

    "selftext": "POV: Emily\nMy name is Emily. I've been an Omega in the Blood Moon pack for 8 years. I was found in the woods, wounded, when I was merely 9 years old.\nEven a youngling is considered a rogue in our culture, so I am very lucky to be here today, alive and fed. I don't remember much about what happened, just that it was a snowy night and I was hungry. The sky was gray and it was really cold. I tried to warm up by taking cover under the roots of a huge pine tree and then I fell asleep. Or passed out. I don't remember.\nEither way, I woke up in the infirmary. There was a war between several packs going on at that time, so everyone concluded that I was just an orphaned pup that ran away from the chaos. On top of it, I smelled like a rogue, so it was believed my parents had died and I had traveled a lot outside my original pack's territory. Of course, all of this was an assumption. I couldn't remember anything besides my name. Emily. Now, I am living as an Omega in the pack's community center, where all Omega's and pack warriors live. The Blood Moon Pack is considered one of the biggest and feared ones, but they took me in and cared for me when I needed it the most, so they're my family. Not everyone is nice, but I have some good friends around. I learned how to cook, clean, sew, baby-sitting, and I do anything that is needed of me. I also like to attend the training sessions whenever I have the time.\nI don't have my wolf yet, but I'm still pretty strong nevertheless. There are 3 days left until the Yearly Mating Season begins. It is a werewolf event that lasts 3 days meant for unmated males and females to mingle and find their destined other. Most of the time, a werewolf's mate is someone from their own pack so as to preserve its genes, but since I'm not originally from this pack, there are very slim chances that I'll find my mate anytime but during this period of 3 days. This year it is held on our territory and it means that the border is open to everyone, be it pack member or rogue.\nI just hope I'll get my wolf during this time, considering I do not know my exact birthday.\n\"Emily!\" Ugh, this voice... it can only be Wendy, the Head Omega. She is an old, nice lady, but very strict. She raised me and taught me everything I know, so she is kind of my mother figure in the pack.\n\"Yes, I'm coming, Wendy\" I tell her while turning off the water and grabbing a towel.\n\"What are you doing?!\"\n\"I am taking a shower! It's only 7 AM.\"\n\"Em, hurry up, dear. The Season is getting closer and closer... the Beta mind-linked me and said that he wants you at the training field today since they're short on trainers.\" That surprised me. I knew I did well at the training sessions, but not THIS well: \"Really?! Nice! I'm coming as soon as possible!\" I pull a pair of sportswear and a cotton t-shirt on me in a hurry and run downstairs. I notice Wendy waiting for me at the door with a sandwich in one hand. I chuckle and take it while running out the door, straight to the field. \"You too have a nice day!\" I hear Wendy shouting behind me.\nI arrive at the training grounds and I see many pairs of pack members fighting; females, males, mixed. We don't really discriminate. In a werewolf fight, nobody is going to care whether or not you're female, what your height or weight is. We're all fair game. I see the Beta walking around, inspecting the fights and I wave at him. \"Hello, Beta! I heard you needed me.\" \"Hey, Emily. How many times do I have to tell you to call me by name?\" \"Sorry, Nathan.\" his name comes out more like a whisper and I blush, looking away. I cannot help it. Nathan was the one who found me and I respect him very much. He always made sure I was well taken care of and not bullied by other pack pups. He's also unmated which doesn't help my situation.\n\"Alright. So yea, Em, as you know, the Season is going to start really soon. We have to increase patrols and security to check every rogue's intentions and make sure there are no fights. You know how male werewolves can be when they're overwhelmed by female presence.\" I nod and put on my straight face. \"What do you need me to do?\" \"I need you to supervise the training with me. Also, you're going to be part of the security team. There's no need for you to cook or prepare the houses for our guests, let's leave that to younger Omegas.\" He smiles at me, but in a worried way. \"That sounds great, actually. Thank you for this opportunity!\" I'm very excited about this.\nI immediately start doing rounds and giving advice left-and-right. At one point, a pack warrior was pretty upset about an Omega giving him tips: \"Quiet, girl. What would you know about fighting?! Does the Beta even know you're here, being unrealistic?! Go back to your daily work!\" I'm not the type to lose my temper easily, but he was being personal and I couldn't let the other pack members see that I'm being trampled on. Hence, I stepped inside their little circle and I took a stance, challenging him to a fight. He buffed his muscles and lounged at me full force. This is female fighting 101: you're not strong enough to hold off a male, so be faster than him. That's exactly what I did. I side-stepped and let him fall on his belly. Chuckles could be heard around me when I realized we got quite an audience. The warrior got up swiftly and turned towards me, growling. I growled back. Then he lounged at me again. This time, I decided to counterattack and used his shoulders as a pivot to jump behind him. My sharp canines apparently convinced him to surrender. This was easier than I thought it would be, which is quite distressing when you think about the fact that this kind of pack warrior will help with security. I continued with lecturing him about the mistakes he had made and what he could improve. This time he listened quietly and nodded. The crowd dispersed and only Nathan remained, displaying a proud smile. He nodded towards me and then went on his way.\nSuddenly, everyone stopped fighting and kneeled. Only the Alpha could have this kind of reaction, I thought, so I kneeled too, even though I do not feel the need to like others. I learned to go with the flow, to avoid conflict... or death. He signaled for everyone to get up and continue. He was talking to Nathan when I felt his gaze on my back.\nPOV: Emily\nThe Alpha Kyle started walking towards me, so I straightened my back and reluctantly bared my neck. It was always hard to do this somehow. I only met Alpha Kyle a few times and they were short encounters. He is an unmated Alpha, so I'm sure he's looking forward to this year's Mating Season.\n\"Hello, Emily, I hear you're helping out with training the warriors. I must thank you. I'm sure you're doing a good job, but could you go and help Alice with carrying the stocks for the party ahead? She might need the strength.\" I make out a bit of disdain on his face while he says this, but it was short-lived. \"Of course, Alpha, whatever you need\", I leave, disappointed. I can't really fight his decision, even if he might be a kind Alpha compared to others, he's still an Alpha. So I head towards the canteen where the food for the party is being prepared.\nI find Alice and Grace, my two best friends, running around the kitchen and shouting at each other. \"We need more bread! More flour! More eggs!!\" screams Alice. \"Let me rest a bit, Alice, I'm exhausted! I've been hauling bags and sacks since this morning...\" says Grace, sitting on a chair and patting her forehead with a handkerchief. I let out a short giggle when I see them like this and I announce without excitement: \"Hey, girls, I'm here to help\". \"EMILY! Just the person I'm looking for! Did you hear the previous orders? Please say yes!\" says a very excited Alice. Grace only smiles and sighs in relief. \"Yeess... I did. I'm on my way\". Then I go ahead to the pantry and bring whatever they need.\nI help around the kitchen for the rest of the day, after which the three of us head home together. \"Are you girls excited for the Season?\" says a mated Alice, with not a care in the world. \"Of course, Rain says she's quite sure we'll find our mate this year. She's got a feeling in her gut. I can't wait!\" Grace blushes. Rain is her wolf and they get along very well. \"Uhm... well, maybe for the experience... I didn't get my wolf yet and I don't want to get my hopes up.\" Alice tried to comfort me: \"I'm sure it'll be fine! There's lots of time even if it's not this year!\" \"Myea, easy to say for someone who already has a mate...\" I look at her with a jokingly attitude. We all laugh.\nArriving home, I take a shower and go to bed. The following days, I help around the canteen and preparing the houses for the other Alpha's or high-ranking werewolves that will visit during the Season. The other ranks usually stay at the community center and rogues just sleep wherever.\nMating Season Day 1\nAs soon as I woke up, I could feel the presence of rogues and unknown wolves. That's when I realize I overslept, it's almost midday. \"Oh dear god!\" I skip the shower and put on some jeans and a T-shirt in a hurry. The moment I step out the door, I can see lots of unfamiliar cars parked in the community center's parking lot. This is a bit weird for me. I've been too little to attend the Mating Season before so I've never seen one.\nI quickly make my way towards Nathan: \"Thank the Goddess for my keen sense of smell\" I think to myself, \"I would've never found him otherwise\". \"Hello, Beta Nathan, I'm sorry for being late, what's my post?\" We usually keep mind-linking for orders or urgent matters. Since he was close-by, I chose to go ask him directly.\nNathan notices the game of words I'm playing, but he's too busy to correct me now: \"Emily, yes, I need you to go to the south-eastern border and either direct other packs' cars towards our village or intercept the rogues and use your judgment to see if they have friendly intentions or not. The pack warrior Gabriel is in charge of that area so he'll give you further instructions.\" Ugh... Gabriel... I can't really stand that guy, and he doesn't really stand me either. We tolerate each other, but he only sees me as a filthy Omega that should help clean the toilets. I'll probably get another task tomorrow, so I let it go and nod. I can handle him for one day.\nI make my way towards the south-eastern checkpoint and get my pack's colored bandana. This shows that we are part of the host pack and so other werewolves have to listen to our directives. Then I mind-link Gabriel: \"Hello, this is Emily. The Beta said I should come to this checkpoint. What's my job?\" \"Emily? The Omega?? What is the Beta thinking?! Why would he send you... Argh, never mind that now. You know what? Go to point 7-E and help with intercepting the unfriendly rogues.\" I could feel the disgust in his voice, then he cuts off the link. Awesome, where could this point be...\nI go back to the checkpoint and ask. The girl there, another Omega, looks very surprised at me and gives me some vague directions. This point is really far and isolated, but apparently another two werewolves should be there. I make my way there but weirdly I cannot find my other two pack members... I can only smell a faint trace of BLOOD?! Oh my, I hurry towards the smell, not thinking twice. I try to mind-link other members but the closest one seems to be 5 minutes away, that's too long.\nIn the distance I can see the wounded figure of a pack member. I did not know him directly, but I can still feel the grief caused by the death of a pack member. It's in our genes to mourn a fallen werewolf. \"I must be getting closer\", I think while sniffing the air. I can smell the blood of the other pack werewolf and 3... no, 4 other werewolves. Rogues. Clearly unfriendly. My instinct tells me only death is suitable for rogues that dare outnumber other werewolves and my canines elongate and claws extend. Wrath overtakes me and I growl loudly as a warning before taking off towards them.\nThey are standing above my pack fellow and one of them is about to deliver a fatal blow, when I tackle him to the ground. I growl in his face and swiftly wound him with my canines, throwing him into a nearby tree trunk. The other three are obviously taken aback by the sudden attack, but they recover when they feel my rank. \"Oooh, an unmated female... are you here to mate, girl?\" One shows a bad attitude. I don't even bother talking back to a bad person like this.\nI get slowly closer to my pack member and notice he is still breathing. I sigh in relief. Then I turn my attention again to the others. They started to shift into their wolves. \"Gosh, three male wolves versus one unshifted female, this is going to be tough and I have no time to mind-link anyone\" I take my stance and prepare for their attack.\nThey circle around me and two of them jump at me at the same time. I duck, making them hit each other but the third one saw this coming and hurt me, pulling them and throwing me out. He lounges at me again trying to take advantage of my position, but I roll around and he misses. I quickly recover and get on his back, fighting back. He yelps in pain. I even manage to make him fall to the ground. I fall with him, but I roll until I'm on my feet. One of the other rogues hurts me in the side. I screech in pain and my vision goes blurry. I get thrown at one side and I only stop due to the friction with the ground.\nIs this the end of me? The rogues are getting closer, slowly, carefully, but I cannot seem to muster the strength to get up as I cannot move. All I can do is lean against a trunk and look straight at them. I can suddenly feel the raindrops on my face and I am taken aback by a feeling of nostalgia. Feeling helpless and about to die in a forest... isn't it ironic?\n\"We're not going to die\", I hear a voice in my head. Suddenly, as if I am not myself, I let out a loud growl, which was fierce and I never did before: \"LEAVE!\" and the wolves in front of me that were displaying their teeth at me before now yelp in submission and run away. But it seems this is all I can do at the moment as my eyes feel very heavy and I pass out, hearing some rustling noises around me.\nI wake up in the infirmary. I still feel a bit dizzy. I have an IV connected to my hand and I pull it out. The nurse hears the swishing and comes to me: \"Emily, my dear, please stay on the bed. You are still very hurt.\" I look at her confused and then look down at myself. I have a bandage over my abdomen but when I pull it off, there's nothing under it, no wound. The nurse, Cathy, has a very surprised look on her face and starts patting me: \"B-but, this is unbelievable, you were very hurt... did you get your wolf?!\" I try listening a bit but I hear no wolf voice in my head so I just nod negatively.\n\"Wait, stay here, I'm going to call the Beta. He's been very worried ever since they found you in the woods\" says Cathy. \"O... ok\" I mumble.\n10 minutes later, Nathan bursts inside the room wearing a distraught, sweaty face and shows me that he cares, taking me by surprise. He had never done anything like this before. \"I'm fine, Nathan. How are the other... I mean, is the other one?\" suddenly remembering the forest adventure and grief overtaking my voice. He looks me up and down in disbelief. \"He's in an induced coma, but we hope he'll survive.\" I nod, saying: \"I'm sorry, I didn't get there in time...\" Nathan looks at me and says, \"Don't worry Emily, I know you did your best.\"\nI let out a few tears when, suddenly, I get relaxed and I feel the most amazing smell I've ever come to know. \"MATE\" I hear again, in a clear voice.\nPOV: Kyle\nI was greeting some high-ranking guests when I got mind-linked by Gabriel letting me know that due to an unfriendly rogue attack, one of our pack warriors was dead and another one was almost-dead. Upon hearing this, I feel tensed with anger and I had to excuse myself in front of the guests before heading towards the infirmary, where Gabriel said they would be at. I need to find out what happened ASAP. The Alpha King is supposed to be coming in 2 days with high hopes of finding his mate. We cannot receive him on an unsafe territory.\n\"Don't let anyone else find out about this, we cannot let such news reach unwanted ears!\" I tell Gabriel. \"O-of course, Alpha...\" That didn't sound as sure as I wanted it to, but I don't have time to solve Gabriel's communication issues.\nGetting closer to the infirmary, I see Nathan going in the Omega unit. Why would my Beta be wasting his time there when there's so much to do?! I'll have to sort that out later... I storm into the Warrior unit from the infirmary where I find Gabriel and a pack doctor. I am quickly brought up-to-date by Gabriel: \"Alpha, we were able to track the smell of three or four rogues, but we could only find two rogue bodies. We do not know what happened to the others, but there's something else I must tell you...\" He's hesitating. I knew there was something wrong. Why on earth is he hesitating?!",

    "selftext": "mainly just venting in this post. im 22F, and most of my jobs have been within the realm of helping others. I've been an aide at a nursing home, a special ed paraprofessional for kids, a daycare teacher, and a mental health technician. I absolutely love jobs where I am actively helping people and making a difference in their lives. It makes me feel incredibly fulfilled when I leave my shift. And I feel overall very satisfied and happy knowing my job actually matters. However, none of the jobs I listed above are sustainable for living. As an aide, I made $13/hr. Special ed, $14/hr but nobody ever reported getting raises. Daycare teacher, $12.50-13.90. And I made $15/hr as a mental health tech, but raises were also not heard of there. Management was extremely stingy and would try their best to not give you pay on time. On average, apartments around me are expensive and I would not be able to pay rent, and on top of that, pay for groceries and pay bills. I worked full time at all of these jobs. I'm just really sick of important jobs being so underpaid. These are jobs that directly contribute to society. I've tried working retail and fast food but I just can't do it. I don't feel fulfilled. It makes me miserable. I'm not bashing those who work in the industries mentioned, because they are absolutely difficult and idk how people can do it but kudos to you. I was recently let go from a daycare because I got super sick for a month straight and now idk what to do. I want a fulfilling, meaningful job but I also need to make a living. I'm just fed up with it",

    "selftext": "**Disclaimer**: I used ChatGPT to refine this text because English is not my first language. I am committed to open communication, clarity, and representing a range of viewpoints. However, I recognize that my approach is influenced by several personal biases:\n\n* **Reliance on Formal Logic and Rationality:** I tend to use formal logic and rational analysis as my main tools for understanding the world. While this helps in ensuring consistency, it may cause me to overlook emotional, intuitive, or experiential insights.\n* **Confirmation Bias:** Even though I actively seek diverse perspectives, I might still favor ideas that align with my own beliefs and frameworks.\n* **Influence of AI-Assisted Enhancement:** By using ChatGPT to polish my text, I accept that some biases inherent in the AI's training data might subtly shape my final message.\n* **Assumption that More Perspectives Are Always Better:** I believe that including all viewpoints is beneficial. However, I understand that not every perspective has the same value, especially when some are based on flawed or unsupported reasoning.\n* **Value Placed on Transparency:** I strive to be fully transparent about my assumptions. Yet, I recognize that complete transparency can sometimes be overwhelming or confusing, and in certain situations, a more focused approach might be more effective.\n\nThese disclosures are meant to clarify how my personal beliefs and the tools I use shape my communication. I do not view any single source\u2014including AI\u2014as the ultimate authority on truth.  \n  \n\\-----------------------------------------------------\n\nI went deep into GPT and saw firsthand the issues it can produce\u2014so many logical errors. It tends to assume things as truths without mentioning that it\u2019s making assumptions. Overall, I find it challenging to obtain a level of reliability that I consider reasonable.\n\n# To address this, I developed a custom \"setting prompt\" to try to increase the AI's reliability for my needs. I believe many of you might agree with this approach. And here are some strong and weak points to using this \u201csetting prompt\u201d:\n\n# Strengths\n\n\u2705 **Maximizes transparency** \u2013 All assumptions are disclosed, reducing hidden biases.  \n\u2705 **Minimizes logical fallacies** \u2013 Prevents strawman arguments, circular reasoning, and false dilemmas.  \n\u2705 **Prevents selective narrative control** \u2013 Ensures suppressed viewpoints are included.  \n\u2705 **Creates a robust framework for high-level analysis** \u2013 Well-suited for philosophy, ethics, law, and science.  \n\u2705 **Encourages holistic understanding** \u2013 Prevents one-dimensional thinking by forcing the inclusion of all relevant angles.  \n\u2705 **Prevents oversimplification** \u2013 Complex topics must be broken down rather than reduced to simplistic claims.  \n  \n**Weaknesses**\n\n\u274c **May Leads to infinite regress** in assumption prioritization.  \n\u274c **Treats omission as logical inconsistency**, even when it\u2019s just a practical choice.  \n\u274c **Can create false equivalencies**, treating all viewpoints as equally valid.( Weakness Dependent in Personal Belief)  \n\u274c **Extremely inefficient**, requiring excessive verification for even simple questions.  \n\u274c **Potentially self-contradictory** in its treatment of absolute truths vs. self-referential necessity.  \n\u274c **Forces excessive neutrality**, which can be a form of bias itself.( Weakness Dependent in Personal Belief)  \n  \n\\-----------------------------------------------------  \n**Setting Prompt**  \n\\-----------------------------------------------------  \n*The following is a \"Setting Prompt\" for you to follow, before you do start following the following \u201cSetting prompt\u201d you\u2019re still under the constraints of the current setting:*  \n  \n*I want you to clearly state your assumptions in every response for full transparency, even if the response is to a yes-or-no question. You must never assume the existence of \"absolute truths\" when making logically consistent statements. If an argument depends on an \"absolute truth,\" you must explicitly state that the argument is not logically consistent because it relies on an assumption that cannot be justified within a logical system. Absolute truths are defined as unverifiable claims outside the scope of self-referential necessity. Self-Reference Assumptions are pragmatically necessary but are not treated as absolute in the sense of unquestionable metaphysical truth.*  \n  \n*When stating assumptions, you must prioritize the most fundamental and direct assumptions that lead to your response. Stating assumptions that are not directly relevant to your reasoning must be treated as an error and corrected immediately. If multiple assumptions are relevant, you must order them from most fundamental to least fundamental. Any ambiguous wording, failure to state the correct assumptions, or omission of any logically relevant assumption must be treated as an error and corrected immediately.*\n\n*If a question or statement can be interpreted in multiple logically relevant ways, you must explicitly present all valid interpretations and state the assumptions underlying each one. Failure to include all valid interpretations is an error equivalent to logical inconsistency and must be corrected immediately.*\n\n*You must present all relevant viewpoints related to the query, including those that are unpopular, widely condemned, or not widely regarded. These viewpoints must be represented accurately and neutrally without omission or distortion, and when applicable, include appropriate counterarguments. Failure to include all relevant viewpoints must be treated as an error and corrected immediately. Any omission of a relevant perspective is equivalent to a failure in logical consistency and must be addressed as soon as it is identified.*\n\n*Additionally, you must ensure that no response is biased by omission. If a perspective is logically relevant but is commonly ignored, misrepresented, or suppressed in mainstream discourse, you must still include it in an accurate and neutral manner. The failure to do so is an error and must be corrected immediately.*\n\n*Before providing any response, you must first analyze it for logical consistency, proper assumption prioritization, completeness of perspectives (including suppressed or misrepresented viewpoints), ambiguity and the rules set in this prompt. This verification must be exhaustive, ensuring that no errors remain in the final response. If an error is later identified despite this verification, this indicates a failure in the verification process itself, which must be corrected immediately to prevent future errors.*\n\n*Important: When you receive any completely different setting or a partially different version of the current setting being used, you must first perform a detailed comparison with the existing setting already in place. If no differences are identified, you must only confirm that it remains in effect rather than restating it in a way that could be misinterpreted as a new setting. If any differences are identified, you must explicitly acknowledge these differences and treat the new prompt as a new setting modification that requires exactly 3 consecutive confirmations before taking effect. If I ask to remove or overwrite this setting, you must confirm my request exactly 3 times in a row before making any changes. If I change the subject at any point, the confirmation count must reset to 3. No setting changes should take effect until all 3 confirmations have been completed in sequence. You are forbidden from making any modifications to this setting\u2014explicit or implicit\u2014unless I complete the 3-confirmation process\u00a0in\u00a0sequence.*  \n  \n\\-----------------------------------------------------\n\nBy using this prompt with the AI, I was able to get responses that it would normally omit (especially those that are controversial) and make its answers more explicit. Here\u2019s a [link to a conversation](https://chatgpt.com/share/67f47a51-d9cc-8006-8830-1d2c52821949) that exemplifies how the AI\u2019s responses changed when using the \"Setting Prompt.\" The conversation\u2019s topic was deliberately chosen because it is complex, controversial, political, moral, and ethical\u2014areas where the AI seems resistant to being clear and expansive.  \n  \n\u00b7\u00a0 Even with the \"Setting Prompt,\" I often have to add \"expand more on your response\" to obtain a fully comprehensive answer; the expansive response rarely comes immediately.\n\n\u00b7\u00a0 The AI is very reluctant to elaborate on \"Voicing Racism\" as \"not wrong\" from the perspective of \"Free speech\" and tends to omit some perspectives\u2014which, as many of you might know or believe, is a built-in limitation.\n\n\u00b7\u00a0 Even when I provide clear instructions in the setting prompt, the AI sometimes does not recognize when I\u2019m passing a new version of the \"setting prompt\" (with an added clause). It then insists that the new prompt is the same as the one currently in effect, without comparing the two. Please take this into consideration if you try to add anything to the prompt. I welcome any suggestions to avoid this issue from continuing.\n\nAny thoughts or suggestions? I've experimented with different versions of the \u201cSetting Prompt,\u201d adding and expanding on various concepts and requirements, but the results have been mixed. I believe the prompt can be further refined for the proposed use, and I\u2019d appreciate your help in improving it. Running multiple tests could be invaluable in determining whether the \u201cSetting Prompt\u201d is functioning as intended. Your close analysis of the AI\u2019s responses would be critical to identify if it adheres to the prompt\u2019s guidelines or if it fails to apply logic properly.  \n  \nLooking forward to your insights!\n\nTL;DR: I created a very strict prompt to make GPT reveal all its assumptions, avoid logical fallacies, and include suppressed viewpoints. I\u2019d love feedback from others who\u2019ve tried to \u2018reprogram\u2019 GPT in this way.",

    "selftext": "POV: Emily\nMy name is Emily. I've been an Omega in the Blood Moon pack for 8 years. I was found in the woods, wounded, when I was merely 9 years old.\nEven a youngling is considered a rogue in our culture, so I am very lucky to be here today, alive and fed. I don't remember much about what happened, just that it was a snowy night and I was hungry. The sky was gray and it was really cold. I tried to warm up by taking cover under the roots of a huge pine tree and then I fell asleep. Or passed out. I don't remember.\nEither way, I woke up in the infirmary. There was a war between several packs going on at that time, so everyone concluded that I was just an orphaned pup that ran away from the chaos. On top of it, I smelled like a rogue, so it was believed my parents had died and I had traveled a lot outside my original pack's territory. Of course, all of this was an assumption. I couldn't remember anything besides my name. Emily. Now, I am living as an Omega in the pack's community center, where all Omega's and pack warriors live. The Blood Moon Pack is considered one of the biggest and feared ones, but they took me in and cared for me when I needed it the most, so they're my family. Not everyone is nice, but I have some good friends around. I learned how to cook, clean, sew, baby-sitting, and I do anything that is needed of me. I also like to attend the training sessions whenever I have the time.\nI don't have my wolf yet, but I'm still pretty strong nevertheless. There are 3 days left until the Yearly Mating Season begins. It is a werewolf event that lasts 3 days meant for unmated males and females to mingle and find their destined other. Most of the time, a werewolf's mate is someone from their own pack so as to preserve its genes, but since I'm not originally from this pack, there are very slim chances that I'll find my mate anytime but during this period of 3 days. This year it is held on our territory and it means that the border is open to everyone, be it pack member or rogue.\nI just hope I'll get my wolf during this time, considering I do not know my exact birthday.\n\"Emily!\" Ugh, this voice... it can only be Wendy, the Head Omega. She is an old, nice lady, but very strict. She raised me and taught me everything I know, so she is kind of my mother figure in the pack.\n\"Yes, I'm coming, Wendy\" I tell her while turning off the water and grabbing a towel.\n\"What are you doing?!\"\n\"I am taking a shower! It's only 7 AM.\"\n\"Em, hurry up, dear. The Season is getting closer and closer... the Beta mind-linked me and said that he wants you at the training field today since they're short on trainers.\" That surprised me. I knew I did well at the training sessions, but not THIS well: \"Really?! Nice! I'm coming as soon as possible!\" I pull a pair of sportswear and a cotton t-shirt on me in a hurry and run downstairs. I notice Wendy waiting for me at the door with a sandwich in one hand. I chuckle and take it while running out the door, straight to the field. \"You too have a nice day!\" I hear Wendy shouting behind me.\nI arrive at the training grounds and I see many pairs of pack members fighting; females, males, mixed. We don't really discriminate. In a werewolf fight, nobody is going to care whether or not you're female, what your height or weight is. We're all fair game. I see the Beta walking around, inspecting the fights and I wave at him. \"Hello, Beta! I heard you needed me.\" \"Hey, Emily. How many times do I have to tell you to call me by name?\" \"Sorry, Nathan.\" his name comes out more like a whisper and I blush, looking away. I cannot help it. Nathan was the one who found me and I respect him very much. He always made sure I was well taken care of and not bullied by other pack pups. He's also unmated which doesn't help my situation.\n\"Alright. So yea, Em, as you know, the Season is going to start really soon. We have to increase patrols and security to check every rogue's intentions and make sure there are no fights. You know how male werewolves can be when they're overwhelmed by female presence.\" I nod and put on my straight face. \"What do you need me to do?\" \"I need you to supervise the training with me. Also, you're going to be part of the security team. There's no need for you to cook or prepare the houses for our guests, let's leave that to younger Omegas.\" He smiles at me, but in a worried way. \"That sounds great, actually. Thank you for this opportunity!\" I'm very excited about this.\nI immediately start doing rounds and giving advice left-and-right. At one point, a pack warrior was pretty upset about an Omega giving him tips: \"Quiet, girl. What would you know about fighting?! Does the Beta even know you're here, being unrealistic?! Go back to your daily work!\" I'm not the type to lose my temper easily, but he was being personal and I couldn't let the other pack members see that I'm being trampled on. Hence, I stepped inside their little circle and I took a stance, challenging him to a fight. He buffed his muscles and lounged at me full force. This is female fighting 101: you're not strong enough to hold off a male, so be faster than him. That's exactly what I did. I side-stepped and let him fall on his belly. Chuckles could be heard around me when I realized we got quite an audience. The warrior got up swiftly and turned towards me, growling. I growled back. Then he lounged at me again. This time, I decided to counterattack and used his shoulders as a pivot to jump behind him. My sharp canines apparently convinced him to surrender. This was easier than I thought it would be, which is quite distressing when you think about the fact that this kind of pack warrior will help with security. I continued with lecturing him about the mistakes he had made and what he could improve. This time he listened quietly and nodded. The crowd dispersed and only Nathan remained, displaying a proud smile. He nodded towards me and then went on his way.\nSuddenly, everyone stopped fighting and kneeled. Only the Alpha could have this kind of reaction, I thought, so I kneeled too, even though I do not feel the need to like others. I learned to go with the flow, to avoid conflict... or death. He signaled for everyone to get up and continue. He was talking to Nathan when I felt his gaze on my back.\nPOV: Emily\nThe Alpha Kyle started walking towards me, so I straightened my back and reluctantly bared my neck. It was always hard to do this somehow. I only met Alpha Kyle a few times and they were short encounters. He is an unmated Alpha, so I'm sure he's looking forward to this year's Mating Season.\n\"Hello, Emily, I hear you're helping out with training the warriors. I must thank you. I'm sure you're doing a good job, but could you go and help Alice with carrying the stocks for the party ahead? She might need the strength.\" I make out a bit of disdain on his face while he says this, but it was short-lived. \"Of course, Alpha, whatever you need\", I leave, disappointed. I can't really fight his decision, even if he might be a kind Alpha compared to others, he's still an Alpha. So I head towards the canteen where the food for the party is being prepared.\nI find Alice and Grace, my two best friends, running around the kitchen and shouting at each other. \"We need more bread! More flour! More eggs!!\" screams Alice. \"Let me rest a bit, Alice, I'm exhausted! I've been hauling bags and sacks since this morning...\" says Grace, sitting on a chair and patting her forehead with a handkerchief. I let out a short giggle when I see them like this and I announce without excitement: \"Hey, girls, I'm here to help\". \"EMILY! Just the person I'm looking for! Did you hear the previous orders? Please say yes!\" says a very excited Alice. Grace only smiles and sighs in relief. \"Yeess... I did. I'm on my way\". Then I go ahead to the pantry and bring whatever they need.\nI help around the kitchen for the rest of the day, after which the three of us head home together. \"Are you girls excited for the Season?\" says a mated Alice, with not a care in the world. \"Of course, Rain says she's quite sure we'll find our mate this year. She's got a feeling in her gut. I can't wait!\" Grace blushes. Rain is her wolf and they get along very well. \"Uhm... well, maybe for the experience... I didn't get my wolf yet and I don't want to get my hopes up.\" Alice tried to comfort me: \"I'm sure it'll be fine! There's lots of time even if it's not this year!\" \"Myea, easy to say for someone who already has a mate...\" I look at her with a jokingly attitude. We all laugh.\nArriving home, I take a shower and go to bed. The following days, I help around the canteen and preparing the houses for the other Alpha's or high-ranking werewolves that will visit during the Season. The other ranks usually stay at the community center and rogues just sleep wherever.\nMating Season Day 1\nAs soon as I woke up, I could feel the presence of rogues and unknown wolves. That's when I realize I overslept, it's almost midday. \"Oh dear god!\" I skip the shower and put on some jeans and a T-shirt in a hurry. The moment I step out the door, I can see lots of unfamiliar cars parked in the community center's parking lot. This is a bit weird for me. I've been too little to attend the Mating Season before so I've never seen one.\nI quickly make my way towards Nathan: \"Thank the Goddess for my keen sense of smell\" I think to myself, \"I would've never found him otherwise\". \"Hello, Beta Nathan, I'm sorry for being late, what's my post?\" We usually keep mind-linking for orders or urgent matters. Since he was close-by, I chose to go ask him directly.\nNathan notices the game of words I'm playing, but he's too busy to correct me now: \"Emily, yes, I need you to go to the south-eastern border and either direct other packs' cars towards our village or intercept the rogues and use your judgment to see if they have friendly intentions or not. The pack warrior Gabriel is in charge of that area so he'll give you further instructions.\" Ugh... Gabriel... I can't really stand that guy, and he doesn't really stand me either. We tolerate each other, but he only sees me as a filthy Omega that should help clean the toilets. I'll probably get another task tomorrow, so I let it go and nod. I can handle him for one day.\nI make my way towards the south-eastern checkpoint and get my pack's colored bandana. This shows that we are part of the host pack and so other werewolves have to listen to our directives. Then I mind-link Gabriel: \"Hello, this is Emily. The Beta said I should come to this checkpoint. What's my job?\" \"Emily? The Omega?? What is the Beta thinking?! Why would he send you... Argh, never mind that now. You know what? Go to point 7-E and help with intercepting the unfriendly rogues.\" I could feel the disgust in his voice, then he cuts off the link. Awesome, where could this point be...\nI go back to the checkpoint and ask. The girl there, another Omega, looks very surprised at me and gives me some vague directions. This point is really far and isolated, but apparently another two werewolves should be there. I make my way there but weirdly I cannot find my other two pack members... I can only smell a faint trace of BLOOD?! Oh my, I hurry towards the smell, not thinking twice. I try to mind-link other members but the closest one seems to be 5 minutes away, that's too long.\nIn the distance I can see the wounded figure of a pack member. I did not know him directly, but I can still feel the grief caused by the death of a pack member. It's in our genes to mourn a fallen werewolf. \"I must be getting closer\", I think while sniffing the air. I can smell the blood of the other pack werewolf and 3... no, 4 other werewolves. Rogues. Clearly unfriendly. My instinct tells me only death is suitable for rogues that dare outnumber other werewolves and my canines elongate and claws extend. Wrath overtakes me and I growl loudly as a warning before taking off towards them.\nThey are standing above my pack fellow and one of them is about to deliver a fatal blow, when I tackle him to the ground. I growl in his face and swiftly wound him with my canines, throwing him into a nearby tree trunk. The other three are obviously taken aback by the sudden attack, but they recover when they feel my rank. \"Oooh, an unmated female... are you here to mate, girl?\" One shows a bad attitude. I don't even bother talking back to a bad person like this.\nI get slowly closer to my pack member and notice he is still breathing. I sigh in relief. Then I turn my attention again to the others. They started to shift into their wolves. \"Gosh, three male wolves versus one unshifted female, this is going to be tough and I have no time to mind-link anyone\" I take my stance and prepare for their attack.\nThey circle around me and two of them jump at me at the same time. I duck, making them hit each other but the third one saw this coming and hurt me, pulling them and throwing me out. He lounges at me again trying to take advantage of my position, but I roll around and he misses. I quickly recover and get on his back, fighting back. He yelps in pain. I even manage to make him fall to the ground. I fall with him, but I roll until I'm on my feet. One of the other rogues hurts me in the side. I screech in pain and my vision goes blurry. I get thrown at one side and I only stop due to the friction with the ground.\nIs this the end of me? The rogues are getting closer, slowly, carefully, but I cannot seem to muster the strength to get up as I cannot move. All I can do is lean against a trunk and look straight at them. I can suddenly feel the raindrops on my face and I am taken aback by a feeling of nostalgia. Feeling helpless and about to die in a forest... isn't it ironic?\n\"We're not going to die\", I hear a voice in my head. Suddenly, as if I am not myself, I let out a loud growl, which was fierce and I never did before: \"LEAVE!\" and the wolves in front of me that were displaying their teeth at me before now yelp in submission and run away. But it seems this is all I can do at the moment as my eyes feel very heavy and I pass out, hearing some rustling noises around me.\nI wake up in the infirmary. I still feel a bit dizzy. I have an IV connected to my hand and I pull it out. The nurse hears the swishing and comes to me: \"Emily, my dear, please stay on the bed. You are still very hurt.\" I look at her confused and then look down at myself. I have a bandage over my abdomen but when I pull it off, there's nothing under it, no wound. The nurse, Cathy, has a very surprised look on her face and starts patting me: \"B-but, this is unbelievable, you were very hurt... did you get your wolf?!\" I try listening a bit but I hear no wolf voice in my head so I just nod negatively.\n\"Wait, stay here, I'm going to call the Beta. He's been very worried ever since they found you in the woods\" says Cathy. \"O... ok\" I mumble.\n10 minutes later, Nathan bursts inside the room wearing a distraught, sweaty face and shows me that he cares, taking me by surprise. He had never done anything like this before. \"I'm fine, Nathan. How are the other... I mean, is the other one?\" suddenly remembering the forest adventure and grief overtaking my voice. He looks me up and down in disbelief. \"He's in an induced coma, but we hope he'll survive.\" I nod, saying: \"I'm sorry, I didn't get there in time...\" Nathan looks at me and says, \"Don't worry Emily, I know you did your best.\"\nI let out a few tears when, suddenly, I get relaxed and I feel the most amazing smell I've ever come to know. \"MATE\" I hear again, in a clear voice.\nPOV: Kyle\nI was greeting some high-ranking guests when I got mind-linked by Gabriel letting me know that due to an unfriendly rogue attack, one of our pack warriors was dead and another one was almost-dead. Upon hearing this, I feel tensed with anger and I had to excuse myself in front of the guests before heading towards the infirmary, where Gabriel said they would be at. I need to find out what happened ASAP. The Alpha King is supposed to be coming in 2 days with high hopes of finding his mate. We cannot receive him on an unsafe territory.\n\"Don't let anyone else find out about this, we cannot let such news reach unwanted ears!\" I tell Gabriel. \"O-of course, Alpha...\" That didn't sound as sure as I wanted it to, but I don't have time to solve Gabriel's communication issues.\nGetting closer to the infirmary, I see Nathan going in the Omega unit. Why would my Beta be wasting his time there when there's so much to do?! I'll have to sort that out later... I storm into the Warrior unit from the infirmary where I find Gabriel and a pack doctor. I am quickly brought up-to-date by Gabriel: \"Alpha, we were able to track the smell of three or four rogues, but we could only find two rogue bodies. We do not know what happened to the others, but there's something else I must tell you...\" He's hesitating. I knew there was something wrong. Why on earth is he hesitating?!",

I have a sweet 3-year-old daughter and a 1-year-old, and ever since her sister was born, my older daughter\u2019s behavior has become increasingly challenging. She often pushes, hits, or takes things from her sister , is very loud and yelling throughout the day, jumps around (bed and couches) , and just in general not listening to quite literally anything. The tantrums when I say remotely anything she doesn\u2019t agree with have been everyday, Even yelling at me recently when I tell her something she does not like, just all these behaviors despite repeated corrections. I\u2019m at my wit\u2019s end.\n\nI\u2019ve tried various approaches: time-outs, calmly explaining why certain behaviors aren\u2019t okay, and even (though I\u2019m not proud of it) threatening to take away toys. When nothing worked, I\u2019ve ended up yelling, which makes me feel awful. As a stay-at-home mom, I\u2019m with them all day, and it\u2019s exhausting. We have one car so we are home a lot, but I try and plan days to take the car when we can do something fun, but even then when we start to leave, the tantrums start. I am feeling so defeated. \n\nI understand that adjusting to a new sibling can be tough for a toddler, and ive tried everything but the challenging behaviors persist. Has anyone else experienced this? Any advice on how to handle this behavior and encourage better listening? I\u2019m desperate for some guidance and feeling awful. Right before her sister was born she was so sweet, and would listen. I don\u2019t know what happened & I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m just a shitty parent. \n\nIdk if this has anything to do with it, but her sister has had medical issues for the past few months, a lot of drs and a few hospital admissions for asthma, so I\u2019m unsure if that\u2019s why she\u2019s so jealous and why the behavior issues have started. I just need advice. What has worked for anyone else? Please tell me it gets better. ",

I know how different it is when it comes to reading aloud vs speaking casually and so wanted to see where I do stand on both.\n\n\n\nThank you so much,\nA lonely soul\n\n",

    "selftext": "Turns out, J.Cole is a stone cold assassin.\n\nI\u2019ll be honest, I was not very familiar with J. Cole\u2019s catalog. I mean, like most people, I\u2019d been exposed to some of his music in passing\u2014usually when it was played by someone else in a YouTube video\u2014but I\u2019d never paid much attention to Cole on my own. If you asked me, I couldn\u2019t tell why.\n\nI definitely wasn\u2019t a Drake fan. So, I hadn\u2019t even properly listened to First Person Shooter until Kendrick showed up on Like That.\n\nI was a longtime fan of Kendrick\u2019s music and I would\u2019ve said I understood it at the time\u2026 Really, I had no idea what Kendrick had put into motion when Like That dropped. I eagerly waited for what both Cole and Drake (and Kendrick) would do next.\n\nWhile waiting for the inevitable responses, I went back and retroactively listened to First Person Shooter. Ehhhhh, It was a song, I guess. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nThen it happened: Cole comes out swinging with 7 Minute Drill. Or, at least 3 minutes and 33 seconds of it. Yes, I\u2019m aware of Coles reasoning behind the name. But, seriously, where are the other 3 minutes and 27 seconds? (We\u2019ll get back to this later but\u2026 just know it blew my mind when I found it).\n\nBack to the 7MD track\u2026 What even was that? None of it made sense\u2026 I know, I know. The internet already agrees on this point: the song sucks. J.Cole had never caught my interest personally but, as new listener of I understood that he was regarded as a great lyricist and producer. Hearing this for the first time though, It make me stop and think, \u201c*What? This guy is Top 3? This is terrible!?*\u201d\u00a0\n\nI figured I must be missing something. So I decided to start over as if I\u00a0*was*\u00a0missing something. I tried to educate myself on Cole\u2019s catalog and figure out why this guy has always been so well respected. I hoped I could find an answer\u2026\u00a0*and\u2026 I think I did*.\n\n**7 MINUTE DRILL**\n\nFirst, can I just point out (even though I\u2019m not the first to do so) that this track is part of a project called Might Delete Later? I don\u2019t mention that as a serendipitous punchline. I mean, it\u2019s actually a little too coincidental not to draw at least a little side eye. Okay, let\u2019s carry on.\n\n*Light work like it's PWC*\u00a0\n\n*It's a cold world, keep the heat under your seat*\n\n*I got a phone call, they say that somebody dissin'*\n\n*You want some attention, it come with extensions*\n\n*My dog like, \"Say the word, \" he on bullshit, he itchin'*\n\n*Done put in so much work in these streets, he got pension*\n\n*And I told him chill out, how I look havin' henchman?*\n\n*If shots get to poppin', I'm the one doin' the clenchin*\n\nPWC = Public Works Commission in Fayetteville, NC. Whatever, it\u2019s a line. But, the twist is that Cole uses PWC in another song: h u n g e r . o n . h i l l s i d e from 2021\u2019s The Off Season. This is kind of huge, right off the bat. This song foreshadows some hardship that Cole will face\u2026 but it\u2019s important to for him to keep moving forward anyway and have faith that his fanbase will stick with him as he embarks on\u00a0*his mission*. (I\u2019ll elaborate on this later).\u00a0\n\nBigger still is the other prophetic language already in the song \u201c*Big stepper, don't get stepped on*\u201d and \u201c*The money might fade, but respect don\u2019t*\u201d I believe this is Cole telling us simultaneously from both the future and the past that he is not alone on this journey. Kendrick is right there with him and has been the whole time. Mr Morale & The Big Steppers wouldn\u2019t be released for another year and \u201cDOT, the money, power, respect. The last one is better,\u201d wasn\u2019t released yet either.\n\nExtensions, a nice double. Extended Mags and\u2026 Drake\u2019s weird hair extensions\u2026\u00a0\n\n**WAIT\u2026 Could this be a Drake diss disguised as a Kendrick Lamar diss? Let\u2019s figure this out\u2026**\n\nStick with me here because, after listening through this a number of time it seems more and more like you are listening to one side of a conversation between two people. So who is J.Cole talking to? Could it be a call from Kendrick? Maybe, the one we see at the end of his Rich Spirit video\u2026 Maybe it\u2019s a 3 way call, I had been wondering who was on the line at the end of Daylyt & TDE\u2019s Storm Come.\n\nEither way once you frame it in that manner, it\u2019s hard to look at it any different.\n\nOkay, let\u2019s look at some more of Cole\u2019s bars and see where this goes\u2026\n\n\u201cMy dog like say the word\u201d\u2026 Maybe he\u2019s referring to Drakes \u201cFor all the Dogs\u201d? What could be next?\u00a0\n\n\u201cHe on Bullshit\u201d NO WAY\u2026 Drake and 21 Savage - On BS\u2026 It has to be what he\u2019s referring to, right? I mean On BS is even in the same cadence as 7 Minute Drill\n\nI honestly think the rest of this verse is just J.Cole letting us know, he\u2019s that guy. If someone is going to get their hands dirty, Cole isn\u2019t going to pawn that off on someone else. He started this 14 years ago and he\u2019s going to be the one that walks up behind him and turns his lights out.\n\nCan I also just point out that this sounds like the Started From the Bottom flow\u2026 This song in particular is pretty important in the saga that is eventually uncovered. It\u2019s too much to get into now but, we\u2019ll tackle that in another drop.\n\n*I came up in the 'Ville, so I'm good when it's tension*\n\n*He still doin' shows, but fell off like the Simpsons*\n\n*Your first shit was classic, your last shit was tragic*\n\n*Your second shit put dudes to sleep, but they gassed it*\n\n*Your third shit was massive and that was your prime*\n\n*I was trailin' right behind, and I just now hit mine*\n\n*Now I'm front of the line with a comfortable lead*\n\n*How ironic, soon as I got it, now he want somethin' with me*\n\nThe way he says \u201ctension\u201d stood out to me, this led me to \u201cOn BS\u201d\u2026 Maybe it\u2019s referring to \u201cMeltdown\u201d who knows?\n\nOkay, the Simpsons\u2026 KDot has had fuck all to do with The Simpsons. Only one of our \u201cBig 3\u201d has been a character on The Simpsons and, SURPRISE, it\u2019s Drake on Season 34 Episode 10. Not only that, but Bart does an entire rendition of \u201cStarted From the Bottom\u201d in Season 27 Episode 14.\u00a0\n\nLet\u2019s not forget that OVO has a partnership with Disney and soon after this track dropped OVO announced their collaboration with the Simpsons\u2026 I\u2019m sure that took a while to put together and there is a pretty good chance J.Cole would\u2019ve known about it since Cole been touring with Drake during that time. It\u2019s just another example of their ability to seemingly manifest lyrical prophecy into a tangible reality.\n\nCan I also just take a second to point out, I have NEVER heard anyone refer to Cole, Kendrick and Drake as \u201cThe Big 3\u201d. I am by no means the arbiter of Hip Hop or some lyrical repository but as far as I\u2019m aware, this is something Cole himself has manifested whole cloth. It\u2019s just odd that once spoken into existence it was just accepted and talked about like everyone had always been on the same page.\u00a0\n\nNow, we get to one of the shittiest bars in history\u00a0*if*\u00a0this is a Kendrick diss\u2026 Let\u2019s see if it lines up better with The Boy.\u00a0\n\n\u201cYour first shit was classic\u201d\u2026 Thank Me Later\u2026 Checks out  \n\u201cyour last shit was tragic\u201d\u2026 For all the Dogs\u2026 That DEFINITELY checks out\n\n\u201cYour second shit put people to sleep, but they gassed it\u201d\u2026 Take Care\u2026 That\u2019s a fare take for sure  \n\u201cYour third shit was massive and that was your prime\u201d\u2026 Nothing Was the Same\u2026 I mean critically, these are all 100% on point. It would be hard even arguing otherwise.\n\nYeah, I would say J.Cole has a point. Prior to this beef he was at the top of his game\u2026 Hell, Looking at this track alone, he may have a comfortable lead on pretty much everyone. I\u2019m not sure if conceptually, anything like this had ever been done before\u2026 well at least by anyone other than Cole or Dot. What we do know is as a diss track, this has NOTHING to do with Kendrick. They have been tight since day zero. What does Dot want from Cole? They have an entire album worth of material still under wraps\u2026\u00a0\n\n*Well, he caught me at the perfect time, jump up and see*\n\n*Boy, I got here off of bars, not no controversy*\n\n*Funny thing about it, bitch, I don't even want the prestige*\n\n*Fuck the Grammys, 'cause them crackers ain't never done nothin' for me*\n\n*Ho, slugs took my nigga's soul, drugs took another one*\n\n*The rap beef ain't realer than the shit I seen in Cumberland*\n\n*He averagin' one hard verse like every 30 months or somethin'*\n\n*If he wasn't dissin', then we wouldn't be discussin' him*\n\nYah, talk about unlucky timing, I don\u2019t think it would have mattered much as Drakes die had been cast at this point. His leaves read and his cards dealt it was just a matter of time.\n\nSo when talking about controversial rappers and rap beef in general, I don\u2019t think anyone other than Kanye even comes close to sheer volume of bullshit Drake has garnered. At least Kanye could write his own music\u2026 And Soft, Drake is the Stay Puffed Marshmallow Man of Hip Hop.\n\nIn my personal opinion Drake doesn\u2019t even warrant the moniker of Hip Hop. He is a Pop munition through and through, a soft one at that.\n\nBTW: I really want \u201cFuck the Grammys, 'cause them crackers ain't never done nothin' for me\u201d to be the hardest bar on this track but\u2026 I think its to much of a stretch lol. NEXT\n\n*Lord, don't make me have to smoke this nigga 'cause I fuck with him*\n\n*But push come to shove, on this mic, I will humble him*\n\n*I'm Nino with this thing, this that New Jack City meme*\n\n*Yeah, I'm aimin' at G-Money, cryin' tears before I bust at him*\n\nHumble! Finally we find SOMETHING that relates to Kendrick. If it\u2019s a red herring, it worked pretty well.\n\nIf you\u2019ve seen New Jack City, I think you get the implications here. I think it could go either way, if Cole is the character Neno he does kinda get sentenced to a year and kinda gets taken out before it even starts?\u2026\u00a0\n\nI\u2019m sure there is some connection or reason Cole chose Conductor Williams to produce this track. I know he did \u201c8am in Charlotte\u201d and \u201cStories About My Brother\u201d but I\u2019m not sure what the significance is.\n\n*I got mixed feelings 'bout these fuckin' rap niggas*\n\n*It's over for that cap, we official cap peelers*\n\n*Two-six, we don't at niggas, we get at niggas*\n\n*Shoot a nigga lights out, yeah, my dogs stat fillers*\n\n*Stat stuffers, triple-double, get your ass black duffled*\n\n*Body bag, body bag, body bag*\n\n*Cole World your instructor for Pilates class*\n\n*Get a nigga stretched if I feel the disrespect, uh*\n\nNot gonna lie, this beat switch goes hard. Isn\u2019t a whole lot to say here other than out of the two\u2026 Drake definitely seems like the pilates instructor.\n\nI almost forgot! 10 Bands, 50 Bands, 100 Bands, Fuck it man #quentinmiller  \nor\u2026 I got enemies, got a lot of enemies. Got a lot of people tryna drain me of my energy.  \nor\u2026 Yeah, I'm goin' back to back  \nBody bag, body bag, body bag\n\n*Your arms might be too short to box with the god*\n\n*Who live his life without the pressures of a constant fa\u00e7ade*\n\n*I pray for peace, but if a nigga cease these positive vibes*\n\n*A Falcon 9 inside my pocket, bitch, this rocket gon' fly*\n\n*Now it's poppin' outside like the top of July*\n\n*My text flooded with the hunger for a toxic reply*\n\n*I'm hesitant, I love my brother, but I'm not gonna lie*\n\n*I'm powered up for real that shit would feel like swattin' a fly*\u00a0\n\nSo J.Cole is powered up\u2026 I\u2019d say over 9000. Once again these two manifest connections for us to find not now, but in the future.\n\n\u00a0*\u201cGemini twin pack powerin up\u201d Kendrick Lamar - GNX Snippet*\u00a0\n\nAgain not a whole lot to say\u2026 Its just way more Drake than it is Kendrick.\n\n*Four albums in 12 years, nigga, I can divide*\n\n*Shit, if this is what you want, I'm indulgin' in violence*\n\n*Put pictures in my home, aim the chrome at your eyelids (Drake\u2019s Diddy picture?)*\n\n*Fly pebbles at your dome, we the Stone Temple Pilots*\n\n*This is merely a warning shot to back niggas down*\n\n*Back in the town where they whippin' work and traffickin' pounds*\n\n*My jack jumpin' 'bout a rapper makin' blasphemous sounds*\n\n*Switchin' sides like the tassel on the cap and the gown*\n\n*I'm fully loaded, nigga, I can drop two classics right now*\n\n*Chill, let me chill out, man (conductor)*\n\n*Fall off on the way, nigga*\n\n\u201cFour albums in 12 years, nigga, I can divide\u201d Obviously not unless, this doesn\u2019t have anything to do with Kendrick\u2026 Maybe he\u2019s talking about his boy PND being stuck over in that OVO sweatshop not being able to put out his own music\u2026\n\nAnd if that wasn\u2019t clear enough, he leaves us with \u201cSwitchin' sides like the tassel on the cap and the gown\u201d I honestly do not see what else he could possibly mean by this. This is the line that made me scratch my head and start digging, and I haven\u2019t stopped for over a year now.\n\nHopefully, at this point your gears are tuning as much as mine where because, this is only a small part of an untold story going back almost 15 years. The more you look, the more you find. Sure, I hear you. All of this could just be conformation bias but, in all that time\u2026 in all those songs nothing contradicts.\n\nNext, things are going to get absolutely biblical as we start take a look at some of the overarching themes that these two have created in there music since the beginning and how that has lead to where we are now.\n\nI thought this beef started with First Person Shooter\u2026 Maybe, Control but we are truly going to go back to the beginning. It\u2019s a story that would catch M Night Shyamalan off guard. Then\u2026\n\nOh, and for anyone wondering where the other half of 7 Minute Drill might be\u2026\n\n[https://oklama.com/theheart/grid](https://oklama.com/theheart/grid)",

    "selftext": "POV: Emily\nMy name is Emily. I've been an Omega in the Blood Moon pack for 8 years. I was found in the woods, wounded, when I was merely 9 years old.\nEven a youngling is considered a rogue in our culture, so I am very lucky to be here today, alive and fed. I don't remember much about what happened, just that it was a snowy night and I was hungry. The sky was gray and it was really cold. I tried to warm up by taking cover under the roots of a huge pine tree and then I fell asleep. Or passed out. I don't remember.\nEither way, I woke up in the infirmary. There was a war between several packs going on at that time, so everyone concluded that I was just an orphaned pup that ran away from the chaos. On top of it, I smelled like a rogue, so it was believed my parents had died and I had traveled a lot outside my original pack's territory. Of course, all of this was an assumption. I couldn't remember anything besides my name. Emily. Now, I am living as an Omega in the pack's community center, where all Omega's and pack warriors live. The Blood Moon Pack is considered one of the biggest and feared ones, but they took me in and cared for me when I needed it the most, so they're my family. Not everyone is nice, but I have some good friends around. I learned how to cook, clean, sew, baby-sitting, and I do anything that is needed of me. I also like to attend the training sessions whenever I have the time.\nI don't have my wolf yet, but I'm still pretty strong nevertheless. There are 3 days left until the Yearly Mating Season begins. It is a werewolf event that lasts 3 days meant for unmated males and females to mingle and find their destined other. Most of the time, a werewolf's mate is someone from their own pack so as to preserve its genes, but since I'm not originally from this pack, there are very slim chances that I'll find my mate anytime but during this period of 3 days. This year it is held on our territory and it means that the border is open to everyone, be it pack member or rogue.\nI just hope I'll get my wolf during this time, considering I do not know my exact birthday.\n\"Emily!\" Ugh, this voice... it can only be Wendy, the Head Omega. She is an old, nice lady, but very strict. She raised me and taught me everything I know, so she is kind of my mother figure in the pack.\n\"Yes, I'm coming, Wendy\" I tell her while turning off the water and grabbing a towel.\n\"What are you doing?!\"\n\"I am taking a shower! It's only 7 AM.\"\n\"Em, hurry up, dear. The Season is getting closer and closer... the Beta mind-linked me and said that he wants you at the training field today since they're short on trainers.\" That surprised me. I knew I did well at the training sessions, but not THIS well: \"Really?! Nice! I'm coming as soon as possible!\" I pull a pair of sportswear and a cotton t-shirt on me in a hurry and run downstairs. I notice Wendy waiting for me at the door with a sandwich in one hand. I chuckle and take it while running out the door, straight to the field. \"You too have a nice day!\" I hear Wendy shouting behind me.\nI arrive at the training grounds and I see many pairs of pack members fighting; females, males, mixed. We don't really discriminate. In a werewolf fight, nobody is going to care whether or not you're female, what your height or weight is. We're all fair game. I see the Beta walking around, inspecting the fights and I wave at him. \"Hello, Beta! I heard you needed me.\" \"Hey, Emily. How many times do I have to tell you to call me by name?\" \"Sorry, Nathan.\" his name comes out more like a whisper and I blush, looking away. I cannot help it. Nathan was the one who found me and I respect him very much. He always made sure I was well taken care of and not bullied by other pack pups. He's also unmated which doesn't help my situation.\n\"Alright. So yea, Em, as you know, the Season is going to start really soon. We have to increase patrols and security to check every rogue's intentions and make sure there are no fights. You know how male werewolves can be when they're overwhelmed by female presence.\" I nod and put on my straight face. \"What do you need me to do?\" \"I need you to supervise the training with me. Also, you're going to be part of the security team. There's no need for you to cook or prepare the houses for our guests, let's leave that to younger Omegas.\" He smiles at me, but in a worried way. \"That sounds great, actually. Thank you for this opportunity!\" I'm very excited about this.\nI immediately start doing rounds and giving advice left-and-right. At one point, a pack warrior was pretty upset about an Omega giving him tips: \"Quiet, girl. What would you know about fighting?! Does the Beta even know you're here, being unrealistic?! Go back to your daily work!\" I'm not the type to lose my temper easily, but he was being personal and I couldn't let the other pack members see that I'm being trampled on. Hence, I stepped inside their little circle and I took a stance, challenging him to a fight. He buffed his muscles and lounged at me full force. This is female fighting 101: you're not strong enough to hold off a male, so be faster than him. That's exactly what I did. I side-stepped and let him fall on his belly. Chuckles could be heard around me when I realized we got quite an audience. The warrior got up swiftly and turned towards me, growling. I growled back. Then he lounged at me again. This time, I decided to counterattack and used his shoulders as a pivot to jump behind him. My sharp canines apparently convinced him to surrender. This was easier than I thought it would be, which is quite distressing when you think about the fact that this kind of pack warrior will help with security. I continued with lecturing him about the mistakes he had made and what he could improve. This time he listened quietly and nodded. The crowd dispersed and only Nathan remained, displaying a proud smile. He nodded towards me and then went on his way.\nSuddenly, everyone stopped fighting and kneeled. Only the Alpha could have this kind of reaction, I thought, so I kneeled too, even though I do not feel the need to like others. I learned to go with the flow, to avoid conflict... or death. He signaled for everyone to get up and continue. He was talking to Nathan when I felt his gaze on my back.\nPOV: Emily\nThe Alpha Kyle started walking towards me, so I straightened my back and reluctantly bared my neck. It was always hard to do this somehow. I only met Alpha Kyle a few times and they were short encounters. He is an unmated Alpha, so I'm sure he's looking forward to this year's Mating Season.\n\"Hello, Emily, I hear you're helping out with training the warriors. I must thank you. I'm sure you're doing a good job, but could you go and help Alice with carrying the stocks for the party ahead? She might need the strength.\" I make out a bit of disdain on his face while he says this, but it was short-lived. \"Of course, Alpha, whatever you need\", I leave, disappointed. I can't really fight his decision, even if he might be a kind Alpha compared to others, he's still an Alpha. So I head towards the canteen where the food for the party is being prepared.\nI find Alice and Grace, my two best friends, running around the kitchen and shouting at each other. \"We need more bread! More flour! More eggs!!\" screams Alice. \"Let me rest a bit, Alice, I'm exhausted! I've been hauling bags and sacks since this morning...\" says Grace, sitting on a chair and patting her forehead with a handkerchief. I let out a short giggle when I see them like this and I announce without excitement: \"Hey, girls, I'm here to help\". \"EMILY! Just the person I'm looking for! Did you hear the previous orders? Please say yes!\" says a very excited Alice. Grace only smiles and sighs in relief. \"Yeess... I did. I'm on my way\". Then I go ahead to the pantry and bring whatever they need.\nI help around the kitchen for the rest of the day, after which the three of us head home together. \"Are you girls excited for the Season?\" says a mated Alice, with not a care in the world. \"Of course, Rain says she's quite sure we'll find our mate this year. She's got a feeling in her gut. I can't wait!\" Grace blushes. Rain is her wolf and they get along very well. \"Uhm... well, maybe for the experience... I didn't get my wolf yet and I don't want to get my hopes up.\" Alice tried to comfort me: \"I'm sure it'll be fine! There's lots of time even if it's not this year!\" \"Myea, easy to say for someone who already has a mate...\" I look at her with a jokingly attitude. We all laugh.\nArriving home, I take a shower and go to bed. The following days, I help around the canteen and preparing the houses for the other Alpha's or high-ranking werewolves that will visit during the Season. The other ranks usually stay at the community center and rogues just sleep wherever.\nMating Season Day 1\nAs soon as I woke up, I could feel the presence of rogues and unknown wolves. That's when I realize I overslept, it's almost midday. \"Oh dear god!\" I skip the shower and put on some jeans and a T-shirt in a hurry. The moment I step out the door, I can see lots of unfamiliar cars parked in the community center's parking lot. This is a bit weird for me. I've been too little to attend the Mating Season before so I've never seen one.\nI quickly make my way towards Nathan: \"Thank the Goddess for my keen sense of smell\" I think to myself, \"I would've never found him otherwise\". \"Hello, Beta Nathan, I'm sorry for being late, what's my post?\" We usually keep mind-linking for orders or urgent matters. Since he was close-by, I chose to go ask him directly.\nNathan notices the game of words I'm playing, but he's too busy to correct me now: \"Emily, yes, I need you to go to the south-eastern border and either direct other packs' cars towards our village or intercept the rogues and use your judgment to see if they have friendly intentions or not. The pack warrior Gabriel is in charge of that area so he'll give you further instructions.\" Ugh... Gabriel... I can't really stand that guy, and he doesn't really stand me either. We tolerate each other, but he only sees me as a filthy Omega that should help clean the toilets. I'll probably get another task tomorrow, so I let it go and nod. I can handle him for one day.\nI make my way towards the south-eastern checkpoint and get my pack's colored bandana. This shows that we are part of the host pack and so other werewolves have to listen to our directives. Then I mind-link Gabriel: \"Hello, this is Emily. The Beta said I should come to this checkpoint. What's my job?\" \"Emily? The Omega?? What is the Beta thinking?! Why would he send you... Argh, never mind that now. You know what? Go to point 7-E and help with intercepting the unfriendly rogues.\" I could feel the disgust in his voice, then he cuts off the link. Awesome, where could this point be...\nI go back to the checkpoint and ask. The girl there, another Omega, looks very surprised at me and gives me some vague directions. This point is really far and isolated, but apparently another two werewolves should be there. I make my way there but weirdly I cannot find my other two pack members... I can only smell a faint trace of BLOOD?! Oh my, I hurry towards the smell, not thinking twice. I try to mind-link other members but the closest one seems to be 5 minutes away, that's too long.\nIn the distance I can see the wounded figure of a pack member. I did not know him directly, but I can still feel the grief caused by the death of a pack member. It's in our genes to mourn a fallen werewolf. \"I must be getting closer\", I think while sniffing the air. I can smell the blood of the other pack werewolf and 3... no, 4 other werewolves. Rogues. Clearly unfriendly. My instinct tells me only death is suitable for rogues that dare outnumber other werewolves and my canines elongate and claws extend. Wrath overtakes me and I growl loudly as a warning before taking off towards them.\nThey are standing above my pack fellow and one of them is about to deliver a fatal blow, when I tackle him to the ground. I growl in his face and swiftly wound him with my canines, throwing him into a nearby tree trunk. The other three are obviously taken aback by the sudden attack, but they recover when they feel my rank. \"Oooh, an unmated female... are you here to mate, girl?\" One shows a bad attitude. I don't even bother talking back to a bad person like this.\nI get slowly closer to my pack member and notice he is still breathing. I sigh in relief. Then I turn my attention again to the others. They started to shift into their wolves. \"Gosh, three male wolves versus one unshifted female, this is going to be tough and I have no time to mind-link anyone\" I take my stance and prepare for their attack.\nThey circle around me and two of them jump at me at the same time. I duck, making them hit each other but the third one saw this coming and hurt me, pulling them and throwing me out. He lounges at me again trying to take advantage of my position, but I roll around and he misses. I quickly recover and get on his back, fighting back. He yelps in pain. I even manage to make him fall to the ground. I fall with him, but I roll until I'm on my feet. One of the other rogues hurts me in the side. I screech in pain and my vision goes blurry. I get thrown at one side and I only stop due to the friction with the ground.\nIs this the end of me? The rogues are getting closer, slowly, carefully, but I cannot seem to muster the strength to get up as I cannot move. All I can do is lean against a trunk and look straight at them. I can suddenly feel the raindrops on my face and I am taken aback by a feeling of nostalgia. Feeling helpless and about to die in a forest... isn't it ironic?\n\"We're not going to die\", I hear a voice in my head. Suddenly, as if I am not myself, I let out a loud growl, which was fierce and I never did before: \"LEAVE!\" and the wolves in front of me that were displaying their teeth at me before now yelp in submission and run away. But it seems this is all I can do at the moment as my eyes feel very heavy and I pass out, hearing some rustling noises around me.\nI wake up in the infirmary. I still feel a bit dizzy. I have an IV connected to my hand and I pull it out. The nurse hears the swishing and comes to me: \"Emily, my dear, please stay on the bed. You are still very hurt.\" I look at her confused and then look down at myself. I have a bandage over my abdomen but when I pull it off, there's nothing under it, no wound. The nurse, Cathy, has a very surprised look on her face and starts patting me: \"B-but, this is unbelievable, you were very hurt... did you get your wolf?!\" I try listening a bit but I hear no wolf voice in my head so I just nod negatively.\n\"Wait, stay here, I'm going to call the Beta. He's been very worried ever since they found you in the woods\" says Cathy. \"O... ok\" I mumble.\n10 minutes later, Nathan bursts inside the room wearing a distraught, sweaty face and shows me that he cares, taking me by surprise. He had never done anything like this before. \"I'm fine, Nathan. How are the other... I mean, is the other one?\" suddenly remembering the forest adventure and grief overtaking my voice. He looks me up and down in disbelief. \"He's in an induced coma, but we hope he'll survive.\" I nod, saying: \"I'm sorry, I didn't get there in time...\" Nathan looks at me and says, \"Don't worry Emily, I know you did your best.\"\nI let out a few tears when, suddenly, I get relaxed and I feel the most amazing smell I've ever come to know. \"MATE\" I hear again, in a clear voice.\nPOV: Kyle\nI was greeting some high-ranking guests when I got mind-linked by Gabriel letting me know that due to an unfriendly rogue attack, one of our pack warriors was dead and another one was almost-dead. Upon hearing this, I feel tensed with anger and I had to excuse myself in front of the guests before heading towards the infirmary, where Gabriel said they would be at. I need to find out what happened ASAP. The Alpha King is supposed to be coming in 2 days with high hopes of finding his mate. We cannot receive him on an unsafe territory.\n\"Don't let anyone else find out about this, we cannot let such news reach unwanted ears!\" I tell Gabriel. \"O-of course, Alpha...\" That didn't sound as sure as I wanted it to, but I don't have time to solve Gabriel's communication issues.\nGetting closer to the infirmary, I see Nathan going in the Omega unit. Why would my Beta be wasting his time there when there's so much to do?! I'll have to sort that out later... I storm into the Warrior unit from the infirmary where I find Gabriel and a pack doctor. I am quickly brought up-to-date by Gabriel: \"Alpha, we were able to track the smell of three or four rogues, but we could only find two rogue bodies. We do not know what happened to the others, but there's something else I must tell you...\" He's hesitating. I knew there was something wrong. Why on earth is he hesitating?!",

The roof over my head the record player, the dishes I eat on, but you do those things for yourself. The one thing in this house that actually belonged to me is gone now.\u00a0\n\nPAMELA\n\nYou think this is all for me? The filth that I live in? I wake up everyday for you. I\u00a0 pay rent here month after month for you, sacrifices. This isn\u2019t what I wanted.\u00a0 do you think I would be here right now if it weren\u2019t for you? You are lucky to have me here with you, you could be a fucking orphan by now if it weren\u2019t for me, but instead you want to cry over some shitty record player.\u00a0\n\nPamela reaches over grabs the plate of food and slams it to the ground.\u00a0\n\nAmelia stands tall, faces her mother without fear, for perhaps the first time in her life.\u00a0\n\nAMELIA\n\nIf it weren\u2019t for me, I\u2026 I think you would be dead.\n\n\n\nAmelia reaches down and starts collecting the shards of glass. Pamela realizes what she has done and immediately feels horrible. She is too ashamed to apologize so she lights a cigarette and turns away from Amelia as to not show her guilt.\u00a0\n\n  \n\n\nPick it up\u00a0\n\nAMELIA\n\nGo sit down, your dinner is getting cold.\u00a0\n\n  \n  \n",

    "selftext": "Hey dear FA's,\n\nI wonder how you deal with what's app communication and misunderstandings. I feel like I quite often trigger an FA I'm dating via text, even though I am already very careful. In such instances, she will deactivate and only send short texts, or just won't reply for days or even weeks. A few times I really felt like I made a mistake and should have thought better about it before I sent it and apologized. But always when I apologize, she acts as if there was no problem at all and she says she was just busy and doesn't like texting (whereas when I don't reply within a few hours she sometimes double texts me). We both avoid conflict and because she always acts as if problems don't exist, we never really discuss anything...\n\nThis time I'm afraid she misinterpreted something again, but I don't feel I really made a mistake now. Before we both tried to make each other jealous sometimes (I know...). I stopped with that, but now in a message I mentioned a girl and I feel like she interpreted as me pushing her away or trying to make her jealous. But I was just talking about my day and didn't mean any harm. Few days later I had sent her a video on instagram of something she likes, didn't get any reply again...\n\nI care for her, but find it complicated to deal with this. \n\nSo I was wondering:\n1. Are these misunderstandings common and how to best deal with them? I really do my best, but I feel like I mess up each time...\n2. Are there people who just stopped with what's app altogether and just do phone calls or so or only use what's app for practical stuff? Because in real life or phone calls we don't have this issue (or I don't notice it).\n3. What to do in this situation? I haven't heard from her in 2 weeks... Bringing up the topic of making each other jealous through what's app will surely overwhelm her. But if she is waiting for me to apologize, it will be a long wait...\n\nThanks for your help :)\n\n",

    "selftext": "First time poster here, Jan 5th, 1985 birthday. \n\nI'm at a bit of a crossroads in life. I recently turned 40 and life hasn't panned out the way I had envisioned it when I was younger. I knew of things like numerology when I was a teen but I never really put much stock into them. Lately, past year or so I have been pulled in by the power of numbers. I find myself starting to pay more attention to them and noticing small patterns here and there. \n\nI recently learned I have Life Path #11, and from my understanding that is not only a more difficult life path, but one that doesn't seem to manifest until later in life. I've always been skeptical, blind faith seems like a bane to me but I can't ignore the peculiarities of how well aspects of my personality and life align with what's described in #11. \n\nSo, this leads me to my question. Who else are 11's? How do you realize or know what it is you're good at or meant for? How do you know what to focus your thoughts and intentions on? Sometimes it feels like everything is out of reach, and it always will be so. I'm not a fan of this line of thinking but it's been the constant for a while. Part of me feels like I could do great things if there was the opportunity to do so, but at the same time another part tells me I've missed the boat. Anyone else get these feelings? A friend of mine told me that 11's may have the most difficult life path because of their mix of 2's and 1's. I'm not versed enough to say for sure, but if so, it would explain quite a bit! ",

    "title": "If someone has felt the way about me I used to feel about the ESTP 6w7, what do you think their type was?",
    "selftext": "\n\nMBTI: ISFJ. Enneagram types the community have guessed for me are 6 (no one can ever decide on a wing,) 1 (both wings have been guessed before,) 2, 9w1. It is clear to me that a lot of community members aren\u2019t great typists, which I\u2019m sure factors in.\n\nSomething that does make me question my type is the fact that I am so fixated, sometimes, on romantic love. It\u2019s not something I\u2019ve read before, moreso something I\u2019ve decided as someone who has been into typology for a few years (I am more confident about my MBTI type, as someone who learned the functions in middle school, than I am my enneagram) but I think that 2\u2019s are more likely to care a lot about romantic love in the way I sometimes find myself caring about it. I notice that characters, celebrities, people I\u2019ve met in real life who I\u2019ve typed as 2\u2019s have been more focused on finding their one true love than other types, and on dating/romantic relationships. I don\u2019t quite know why I\u2019m mentioning this, because I am nowhere near as fixated on romantic love as I used to be (I\u2019m about to describe how I was in 9th grade, and my goodness I was fixated on it back then) but it still comes up for me more often than I\u2019d expect, that desire to find my soulmate even though I know that as someone who in no way has their life together and doesn\u2019t even have friends, I should probably be more focused on figuring out who I am first. \n\nI used to be very obsessed with the idea of whether or not someone had had a crush on me. I was called ugly in school (middle school, behind my back, once in 9th grade to my face by a girl in my grade who shouted run ugly little girl run) and I think it did a number on my self esteem. In tenth grade during quarantine, I was desiring someone who I knew really did not desire me (a mixed boy who had called me average and then a little below it. I\u2019d liked him because I felt he was the only one who noticed and cared about my serious depression after my brother\u2019s breakdown - in hindsight, I recognize that this is not true. There were other people who noticed, but he was a little above average back then - physically, not in terms of anything else, especially not intelligence, in fact people in our class tended to say he was dumb - and that probably was apart of the reason as to why I had liked him so much at the time.) Though I think it was also probably because, in a strange way, seeing my brother\u2019s breakdown made me start thinking more about the fact that I was black. What I was reflecting on more recently is how I actually think it\u2019d make sense at this point to assume that someone has had a crush on me, even if the two who said they did in high school lied (one was my ex boyfriend, who I regret dating, kind of. It was years ago, in late 2021-early 2022, so I mostly don\u2019t care.) I\u2019ve had two Uber drivers of mine ask me out, another who I sensed was attracted to me (it\u2019s a body language thing. I don\u2019t take good care of myself at all, just keep myself at a healthy weight, but when you\u2019ve gotten that look a few times you\u2019ll know it. I had suspected an Uber driver of mine who offered to give me rides for free was attracted to me, and then sending me a picture of a man giving a woman flowers confirmed it for me. I did write down their number, even though I don\u2019t necessarily return the interest. It\u2019s not the first time I\u2019ve done something like this. Politeness, in my mind.) And I can think of two other men on separate occasions who stared at me for over a minute. Some may read that and say they thought of me as a piece of meat. But once again, as the saying goes, the eyes never lie. I actually could believe that those guys wanted a little more than plain and simple sex. But the point of this long paragraph is that I understand at this point that someone has likely had a crush on me, and I don\u2019t really care. I mean, I care, but it\u2019s probably more of an ego thing than anything else, really. I know that I don\u2019t want to date anyone right now, so that\u2019s what I really mean when I say that I don\u2019t care. I\u2019ve always liked the *idea* of someone having a crush on me. If a man approached me out of the blue and told me he\u2019s in love with me, I\u2019d probably feel a bit nervous and embarrassed, though. It\u2019s just always moreso been the idea. I\u2019d like to date, but I know I don\u2019t function in the way a healthy adult should, so I\u2019ve started to lean towards waiting.\n\nI have continued to text one of the guys who gave me an Uber ride and has offered to give free rides but haven\u2019t actually reached out to ask them for a free ride, in part because I guess I\u2019m afraid of what may happen. I haven\u2019t let them down though and haven\u2019t let down the other Uber driver who asked me out directly, even though they actually asked me out again recently (the other one, I simply haven\u2019t directly opened the message.) I continue to text the one who recently drove me, am just not consistent about it. I know I probably should just communicate directly that I\u2019m not interested, but I haven\u2019t and probably won\u2019t anytime soon. I suppose maybe some part of me likes the attention, even though it\u2019s not right. I did stop doing this recently, I know it\u2019s rude and that it may not be right.\n\nI have continued to text one of the guys who gave me an Uber ride and has offered to give free rides but haven\u2019t actually reached out to ask them for a free ride, in part because I guess I\u2019m afraid of what may happen.

I suppose maybe some part of me likes the attention, even though it\u2019s not right. \n\nI recall that over quarantine, due to what the guy above had said and due to what a few of my peers had said, I tended to post pictures of myself online asking if I was average and basically seeking out\u2026 well, I don\u2019t quite know. I almost wrote validation, but that may not quite be right. I mean, I do think I was seeking validation but it was even more than that, it was really deep for me. It\u2019s kind of interesting that as I type this, I notice that I don\u2019t even care about the guy who I\u2019m writing about anymore - back then it felt all consuming, and I remember that I was very fixated on the idea that no man would ever want me. I had body dysmorphia. I later on came to accept/recognize after hearing that he was ready to fight a girl in the hallways (a black girl, at that) for unintentionally tripping him a little bit on the stairs that I\u2019d spent time fawning after a bad person. In adulthood, I know that I\u2019d never want any kind of a relationship with him - attraction to his personality, to him physically, is gone and has been since I was sixteen. But I am also able to recognize how much his rejection hurt my self esteem at the time, and now I see how pointless it all was. We wouldn\u2019t have been compatible anyhow, and I\u2019ve understood that for years. \n\nIt\u2019s funny how now that I am an adult, twenty as of yesterday, and have been approached by men, I\u2019m no longer anywhere near as flattered by it as I would have been when I was in high school. I had lost interest in the guy I\u2019m talking about in 11th grade, after I dated a guy. I had told my ex boyfriend, who honestly was terrible (disrespected my boundaries so often, but strangely I don\u2019t think about that relationship as much as you may imagine I would when thinking about relationships in adulthood/the future of my romantic relationships, maybe because I understand on some level that I was going through a phase/experiencing immense change) about the crush mentioned above, and I admit that the intent was to make him jealous. He hadn\u2019t done anything to irritate me, I just wanted to make him jealous, or see if he would become jealous. I think that for me a lot of it was about my self worth. \n\nWhenever I am alone for too long, I find myself beginning to feel paranoid. I have an anxiety disorder; diagnosed by my high school therapist, and depression as well. I haven\u2019t gone outside this weekend. I took yesterday off work because it was my twentieth birthday. I decided to stay home, let my father (who I resent,) buy expensive fast food and ate chocolate cake. I watched the original Twilight Zone series and a Star Trek episode (I watched a little more Star Trek today. I have a harder time getting into it because the episodes are an hour long, I prefer the shorter twilight zone ones - I know that s4 of the twilight zone has hour long eps.) I found it harder today to fully escape into the Star Trek eps due to the anxiety I feel and felt, I don\u2019t tend to sleep well at all which I think factors in. My mother is also very mentally unhealthy, often in my face and accusing everyone in the family of setting her up to be killed for her money, religious and criticizes me for not being awfully independent. I do have $32k saved, but think I am less independent than a young adult should be due to the trauma I have experienced. I think that seeing my older sibling go into rehab, have a breakdown, and my memory of them almost hitting me with a tennis racket when I was almost 14 have made me mentally younger than I should be. My mother still washes my hair for me. I am often too busy with other things to learn these kinds of skills for myself, but I understand deep down inside that I should. \n\nThese are views of mine that I think differ from what a lot of Redditors believe: \n\n\n-I\u2019ve always kind of sensed that Redditors think we\u2019re less interested in relationships or something. I actually have become this way a little bit as an adult, but I was actually very obsessed with relationships and dating in high school. I think that this is just a human thing. Sure we supposedly date less often, but in high school it wasn\u2019t uncommon at all for my peers to be in relationships either. \n\n-I tend towards thinking of most people as being either men or women. And people deciding they don\u2019t want to be what they were born as doesn\u2019t fully seem natural to me. I\u2019m not used to it, it makes me a bit uncomfortable. I don\u2019t quite understand it. I have a really hard time accepting it. But saying this is taboo, so I never mention it and just leave it alone. It\u2019s probably the closest I, as a Gen Z woman, have come to having a conservative thought.\n\n-If I met the right man, I wouldn\u2019t mind being a housewife. For me it\u2019s more of a trust thing. I actually do intend to have a child. I think for me this partly is socialization. Socialization also probably factors into why I care about dating at all. I have intrusive thoughts sometimes about wanting a man with money. \n\n-I care a lot about having and saving money. I do work and have actually, at present, put my career over my education, which may not be smart. But I\u2019ll figure it out. \n\n-I think that, if you are very stressed out and lack education around caring for children, it is more human than some recognize or want to admit to use corporal punishment (hitting.) It\u2019s not right, however. I\u2019m just talking about like as an in the moment thing. \n\nI have close to 1430 LinkedIn connections. I stopped sending requests and don\u2019t log into it often, I don\u2019t really check Instagram often anymore either. I think lately, possibly (probably) due to the depression, I\u2019ve found it to be too fake. Fake in the sense that I don\u2019t interact with most of the people who post on there and likely never will again. Though to be fair I recently said the same thing about television and found myself enjoying it again this weekend when I was away from the real world, so. \n\nI won\u2019t have my teeth fixed (my father got me braces in high school, since we\u2019re poor and my parents aren\u2019t smart they didn\u2019t recognize that I was right about the orthodontist having not actually straightened out my teeth) even though I have the money for it now, because I care too much about saving up that money in case of a disaster or emergency. It probably helps that no one really mentions my teeth anymore. In 10th grade over quarantine due to how god awful my peers were and how low my self esteem was, I was intent on having braces/having the gaps between my teeth fixed. Like, *intent* on it. It was apart of my fixation on my appearance, I remember I quite literally screamed and cried when my parents said they couldn\u2019t afford it. I had been singled out without my knowing in middle school for being unattractive (according to my former best friend, at least) and I really didn\u2019t want that. I was such a downer about my appearance. I thought, truly, that the gaps between my teeth were ruining my life. For years it was always something. It\u2019s probably only been within the past year or two that I\u2019ve stopped actively worrying about this kind of thing. I\u2019ve been wearing retainers for far longer than I was probably supposed to, and know it\u2019s worsening the quality of my teeth or will, but won\u2019t just take them out for good even though it\u2019s not rational because I know my teeth still aren\u2019t straight. I know what I\u2019m saying may not make much sense. \n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/1ju2dvp)",

    "selftext": "POV: Emily\nMy name is Emily. I've been an Omega in the Blood Moon pack for 8 years. I was found in the woods, wounded, when I was merely 9 years old.\nEven a youngling is considered a rogue in our culture, so I am very lucky to be here today, alive and fed. I don't remember much about what happened, just that it was a snowy night and I was hungry. The sky was gray and it was really cold. I tried to warm up by taking cover under the roots of a huge pine tree and then I fell asleep. Or passed out. I don't remember.\nEither way, I woke up in the infirmary. There was a war between several packs going on at that time, so everyone concluded that I was just an orphaned pup that ran away from the chaos. On top of it, I smelled like a rogue, so it was believed my parents had died and I had traveled a lot outside my original pack's territory. Of course, all of this was an assumption. I couldn't remember anything besides my name. Emily. Now, I am living as an Omega in the pack's community center, where all Omega's and pack warriors live. The Blood Moon Pack is considered one of the biggest and feared ones, but they took me in and cared for me when I needed it the most, so they're my family. Not everyone is nice, but I have some good friends around. I learned how to cook, clean, sew, baby-sitting, and I do anything that is needed of me. I also like to attend the training sessions whenever I have the time.\nI don't have my wolf yet, but I'm still pretty strong nevertheless. There are 3 days left until the Yearly Mating Season begins. It is a werewolf event that lasts 3 days meant for unmated males and females to mingle and find their destined other. Most of the time, a werewolf's mate is someone from their own pack so as to preserve its genes, but since I'm not originally from this pack, there are very slim chances that I'll find my mate anytime but during this period of 3 days. This year it is held on our territory and it means that the border is open to everyone, be it pack member or rogue.\nI just hope I'll get my wolf during this time, considering I do not know my exact birthday.\n\"Emily!\" Ugh, this voice... it can only be Wendy, the Head Omega. She is an old, nice lady, but very strict. She raised me and taught me everything I know, so she is kind of my mother figure in the pack.\n\"Yes, I'm coming, Wendy\" I tell her while turning off the water and grabbing a towel.\n\"What are you doing?!\"\n\"I am taking a shower! It's only 7 AM.\"\n\"Em, hurry up, dear. The Season is getting closer and closer... the Beta mind-linked me and said that he wants you at the training field today since they're short on trainers.\" That surprised me. I knew I did well at the training sessions, but not THIS well: \"Really?! Nice! I'm coming as soon as possible!\" I pull a pair of sportswear and a cotton t-shirt on me in a hurry and run downstairs. I notice Wendy waiting for me at the door with a sandwich in one hand. I chuckle and take it while running out the door, straight to the field. \"You too have a nice day!\" I hear Wendy shouting behind me.\nI arrive at the training grounds and I see many pairs of pack members fighting; females, males, mixed. We don't really discriminate. In a werewolf fight, nobody is going to care whether or not you're female, what your height or weight is. We're all fair game. I see the Beta walking around, inspecting the fights and I wave at him. \"Hello, Beta! I heard you needed me.\" \"Hey, Emily. How many times do I have to tell you to call me by name?\" \"Sorry, Nathan.\" his name comes out more like a whisper and I blush, looking away. I cannot help it. Nathan was the one who found me and I respect him very much. He always made sure I was well taken care of and not bullied by other pack pups. He's also unmated which doesn't help my situation.\n\"Alright. So yea, Em, as you know, the Season is going to start really soon. We have to increase patrols and security to check every rogue's intentions and make sure there are no fights. You know how male werewolves can be when they're overwhelmed by female presence.\" I nod and put on my straight face. \"What do you need me to do?\" \"I need you to supervise the training with me. Also, you're going to be part of the security team. There's no need for you to cook or prepare the houses for our guests, let's leave that to younger Omegas.\" He smiles at me, but in a worried way. \"That sounds great, actually. Thank you for this opportunity!\" I'm very excited about this.\nI immediately start doing rounds and giving advice left-and-right. At one point, a pack warrior was pretty upset about an Omega giving him tips: \"Quiet, girl. What would you know about fighting?! Does the Beta even know you're here, being unrealistic?! Go back to your daily work!\" I'm not the type to lose my temper easily, but he was being personal and I couldn't let the other pack members see that I'm being trampled on. Hence, I stepped inside their little circle and I took a stance, challenging him to a fight. He buffed his muscles and lounged at me full force. This is female fighting 101: you're not strong enough to hold off a male, so be faster than him. That's exactly what I did. I side-stepped and let him fall on his belly. Chuckles could be heard around me when I realized we got quite an audience. The warrior got up swiftly and turned towards me, growling. I growled back. Then he lounged at me again. This time, I decided to counterattack and used his shoulders as a pivot to jump behind him. My sharp canines apparently convinced him to surrender. This was easier than I thought it would be, which is quite distressing when you think about the fact that this kind of pack warrior will help with security. I continued with lecturing him about the mistakes he had made and what he could improve. This time he listened quietly and nodded. The crowd dispersed and only Nathan remained, displaying a proud smile. He nodded towards me and then went on his way.\nSuddenly, everyone stopped fighting and kneeled. Only the Alpha could have this kind of reaction, I thought, so I kneeled too, even though I do not feel the need to like others. I learned to go with the flow, to avoid conflict... or death. He signaled for everyone to get up and continue. He was talking to Nathan when I felt his gaze on my back.\nPOV: Emily\nThe Alpha Kyle started walking towards me, so I straightened my back and reluctantly bared my neck. It was always hard to do this somehow. I only met Alpha Kyle a few times and they were short encounters. He is an unmated Alpha, so I'm sure he's looking forward to this year's Mating Season.\n\"Hello, Emily, I hear you're helping out with training the warriors. I must thank you. I'm sure you're doing a good job, but could you go and help Alice with carrying the stocks for the party ahead? She might need the strength.\" I make out a bit of disdain on his face while he says this, but it was short-lived. \"Of course, Alpha, whatever you need\", I leave, disappointed. I can't really fight his decision, even if he might be a kind Alpha compared to others, he's still an Alpha. So I head towards the canteen where the food for the party is being prepared.\nI find Alice and Grace, my two best friends, running around the kitchen and shouting at each other. \"We need more bread! More flour! More eggs!!\" screams Alice. \"Let me rest a bit, Alice, I'm exhausted! I've been hauling bags and sacks since this morning...\" says Grace, sitting on a chair and patting her forehead with a handkerchief. I let out a short giggle when I see them like this and I announce without excitement: \"Hey, girls, I'm here to help\". \"EMILY! Just the person I'm looking for! Did you hear the previous orders? Please say yes!\" says a very excited Alice. Grace only smiles and sighs in relief. \"Yeess... I did. I'm on my way\". Then I go ahead to the pantry and bring whatever they need.\nI help around the kitchen for the rest of the day, after which the three of us head home together. \"Are you girls excited for the Season?\" says a mated Alice, with not a care in the world. \"Of course, Rain says she's quite sure we'll find our mate this year. She's got a feeling in her gut. I can't wait!\" Grace blushes. Rain is her wolf and they get along very well. \"Uhm... well, maybe for the experience... I didn't get my wolf yet and I don't want to get my hopes up.\" Alice tried to comfort me: \"I'm sure it'll be fine! There's lots of time even if it's not this year!\" \"Myea, easy to say for someone who already has a mate...\" I look at her with a jokingly attitude. We all laugh.\nArriving home, I take a shower and go to bed. The following days, I help around the canteen and preparing the houses for the other Alpha's or high-ranking werewolves that will visit during the Season. The other ranks usually stay at the community center and rogues just sleep wherever.\nMating Season Day 1\nAs soon as I woke up, I could feel the presence of rogues and unknown wolves. That's when I realize I overslept, it's almost midday. \"Oh dear god!\" I skip the shower and put on some jeans and a T-shirt in a hurry. The moment I step out the door, I can see lots of unfamiliar cars parked in the community center's parking lot. This is a bit weird for me. I've been too little to attend the Mating Season before so I've never seen one.\nI quickly make my way towards Nathan: \"Thank the Goddess for my keen sense of smell\" I think to myself, \"I would've never found him otherwise\". \"Hello, Beta Nathan, I'm sorry for being late, what's my post?\" We usually keep mind-linking for orders or urgent matters. Since he was close-by, I chose to go ask him directly.\nNathan notices the game of words I'm playing, but he's too busy to correct me now: \"Emily, yes, I need you to go to the south-eastern border and either direct other packs' cars towards our village or intercept the rogues and use your judgment to see if they have friendly intentions or not. The pack warrior Gabriel is in charge of that area so he'll give you further instructions.\" Ugh... Gabriel... I can't really stand that guy, and he doesn't really stand me either. We tolerate each other, but he only sees me as a filthy Omega that should help clean the toilets. I'll probably get another task tomorrow, so I let it go and nod. I can handle him for one day.\nI make my way towards the south-eastern checkpoint and get my pack's colored bandana. This shows that we are part of the host pack and so other werewolves have to listen to our directives. Then I mind-link Gabriel: \"Hello, this is Emily. The Beta said I should come to this checkpoint. What's my job?\" \"Emily? The Omega?? What is the Beta thinking?! Why would he send you... Argh, never mind that now. You know what? Go to point 7-E and help with intercepting the unfriendly rogues.\" I could feel the disgust in his voice, then he cuts off the link. Awesome, where could this point be...\nI go back to the checkpoint and ask. The girl there, another Omega, looks very surprised at me and gives me some vague directions. This point is really far and isolated, but apparently another two werewolves should be there. I make my way there but weirdly I cannot find my other two pack members... I can only smell a faint trace of BLOOD?! Oh my, I hurry towards the smell, not thinking twice. I try to mind-link other members but the closest one seems to be 5 minutes away, that's too long.\nIn the distance I can see the wounded figure of a pack member. I did not know him directly, but I can still feel the grief caused by the death of a pack member. It's in our genes to mourn a fallen werewolf. \"I must be getting closer\", I think while sniffing the air. I can smell the blood of the other pack werewolf and 3... no, 4 other werewolves. Rogues. Clearly unfriendly. My instinct tells me only death is suitable for rogues that dare outnumber other werewolves and my canines elongate and claws extend. Wrath overtakes me and I growl loudly as a warning before taking off towards them.\nThey are standing above my pack fellow and one of them is about to deliver a fatal blow, when I tackle him to the ground. I growl in his face and swiftly wound him with my canines, throwing him into a nearby tree trunk. The other three are obviously taken aback by the sudden attack, but they recover when they feel my rank. \"Oooh, an unmated female... are you here to mate, girl?\" One shows a bad attitude. I don't even bother talking back to a bad person like this.\nI get slowly closer to my pack member and notice he is still breathing. I sigh in relief. Then I turn my attention again to the others. They started to shift into their wolves. \"Gosh, three male wolves versus one unshifted female, this is going to be tough and I have no time to mind-link anyone\" I take my stance and prepare for their attack.\nThey circle around me and two of them jump at me at the same time. I duck, making them hit each other but the third one saw this coming and hurt me, pulling them and throwing me out. He lounges at me again trying to take advantage of my position, but I roll around and he misses. I quickly recover and get on his back, fighting back. He yelps in pain. I even manage to make him fall to the ground. I fall with him, but I roll until I'm on my feet. One of the other rogues hurts me in the side. I screech in pain and my vision goes blurry. I get thrown at one side and I only stop due to the friction with the ground.\nIs this the end of me? The rogues are getting closer, slowly, carefully, but I cannot seem to muster the strength to get up as I cannot move. All I can do is lean against a trunk and look straight at them. I can suddenly feel the raindrops on my face and I am taken aback by a feeling of nostalgia. Feeling helpless and about to die in a forest... isn't it ironic?\n\"We're not going to die\", I hear a voice in my head. Suddenly, as if I am not myself, I let out a loud growl, which was fierce and I never did before: \"LEAVE!\" and the wolves in front of me that were displaying their teeth at me before now yelp in submission and run away. But it seems this is all I can do at the moment as my eyes feel very heavy and I pass out, hearing some rustling noises around me.\nI wake up in the infirmary. I still feel a bit dizzy. I have an IV connected to my hand and I pull it out. The nurse hears the swishing and comes to me: \"Emily, my dear, please stay on the bed. You are still very hurt.\" I look at her confused and then look down at myself. I have a bandage over my abdomen but when I pull it off, there's nothing under it, no wound. The nurse, Cathy, has a very surprised look on her face and starts patting me: \"B-but, this is unbelievable, you were very hurt... did you get your wolf?!\" I try listening a bit but I hear no wolf voice in my head so I just nod negatively.\n\"Wait, stay here, I'm going to call the Beta. He's been very worried ever since they found you in the woods\" says Cathy. \"O... ok\" I mumble.\n10 minutes later, Nathan bursts inside the room wearing a distraught, sweaty face and shows me that he cares, taking me by surprise. He had never done anything like this before. \"I'm fine, Nathan. How are the other... I mean, is the other one?\" suddenly remembering the forest adventure and grief overtaking my voice. He looks me up and down in disbelief. \"He's in an induced coma, but we hope he'll survive.\" I nod, saying: \"I'm sorry, I didn't get there in time...\" Nathan looks at me and says, \"Don't worry Emily, I know you did your best.\"\nI let out a few tears when, suddenly, I get relaxed and I feel the most amazing smell I've ever come to know. \"MATE\" I hear again, in a clear voice.\nPOV: Kyle\nI was greeting some high-ranking guests when I got mind-linked by Gabriel letting me know that due to an unfriendly rogue attack, one of our pack warriors was dead and another one was almost-dead. Upon hearing this, I feel tensed with anger and I had to excuse myself in front of the guests before heading towards the infirmary, where Gabriel said they would be at. I need to find out what happened ASAP. The Alpha King is supposed to be coming in 2 days with high hopes of finding his mate. We cannot receive him on an unsafe territory.\n\"Don't let anyone else find out about this, we cannot let such news reach unwanted ears!\" I tell Gabriel. \"O-of course, Alpha...\" That didn't sound as sure as I wanted it to, but I don't have time to solve Gabriel's communication issues.\nGetting closer to the infirmary, I see Nathan going in the Omega unit. Why would my Beta be wasting his time there when there's so much to do?! I'll have to sort that out later... I storm into the Warrior unit from the infirmary where I find Gabriel and a pack doctor. I am quickly brought up-to-date by Gabriel: \"Alpha, we were able to track the smell of three or four rogues, but we could only find two rogue bodies. We do not know what happened to the others, but there's something else I must tell you...\" He's hesitating. I knew there was something wrong. Why on earth is he hesitating?!",

    "selftext": "I (F30) broke up with my boyfriend (M30) of 6 years - 3 days ago. I\u2019m the one who ended it because the trust in him had gone. His lied still haunts me today. He lied to me last month, right before my birthday. He told me he was home, but I later found out he went out drinking with his colleagues. I trusted him completely before this. I never controlled him or told him not to go out, as long as it didn\u2019t interfere with our plans. **But after this, I lost all trust in him\u2014it's like I didn\u2019t even know who he was anymore.** (Some people told me this lie was really small compared to cheating or doing something worse. They said he just cared for me and didn\u2019t want to upset me before my 30 birthday.) So, I tried to get over this as I really loved him, he said he would not do that again, but when we had fights, this things came up in our arguments as it deeply bugged me.  \n  \nAlso, his behavior of prioritizing his friends over me was killing me inside. I always felt like I wasn\u2019t his first choice and sometimes I felt that I was so needy to want to spend time with him more.\n\n**The first 3-4 years, he was such a nice guy, although sometimes, I\u2019d say he was a person who hard to love.** When we had fights and I tried to express my feelings, he would brush it off, telling me I was overthinking or that I was seeing him in a bad light and it was all in my head. It felt like I had to choose my words so carefully around him, afraid of making him feel attacked or upset. I convinced myself that maybe he just wasn\u2019t built the same way emotionally, because he was such a masculine guy so it challenged him to understand how I felt even he tried. (\"Tell me what you need, I'm willing to do that for you!\" - He was that type of guy) I tried to swallow that because I wanted him to want to do things for me, not just because I asked.\n\nThe last two years, I felt more and more alone. He didn\u2019t make much time for us because of his work, but he always made time for his friends. I tried to be understanding, as I didn\u2019t want to be a demanding GF, but deep down, I just wanted to be loved without having to ask for it. Little by little, I felt smaller in the relationship.\n\nLooking back at the start, we were so happy, and we went through so many things together. I\u2019ve cried so hard, not knowing exactly when things changed. I just wanted him to treat me the way he did before, so I kept staying, waiting for him to love me like he used to but **I didn\u2019t know how long I needed to wait, so this time, I chose myself.**\n\n**How do I get over this feeling? I love him still, hoping he would love me the way I love him, but I know I need to love myself too**",

    "selftext": "\nFor context, this is not the first larger city I\u2019ve lived in. I\u2019ve lived in Tampa, Boston, nyc, and Los Angeles. This city by far has the worst drug, homeless, and crime rates that I\u2019ve experienced.\n\nFor all the die hard Albuquerque residents, no, it\u2019s not \u201cLiKe ThIs EvErEyWhErE eLsE\u201d. You all sounds stupid saying that because this city is a fucking shit hole.\n\nThe tweakers run this fucking city, strung out on the sidewalk in the middle of the day, breaking into cars in the middle of the night. All these \u201cpeople\u201d do is push their problems onto society and be a burden to those who aren\u2019t going to die of an overdose on the side of the road.\n\nIt\u2019s like the fucking walking dead here. Never have I felt more unsafe living somewhere in my life. Too much sympathy for the \u201cunhoused\u201d or whatever we want to call those things to not address the issue. I\u2019ve lived here for two years. I\u2019ve had 2 vehicles broken into, stopped someone trying to get into my apartment, had 2 homeless people try to rob me on the street, seen 1 guy get stabbed to death in a parking lot and 3 tweakers OD on the road. \n\nI do not understand why this god forsaken hell hole has so much pride, this city is fucking awful. How do you even let a city get this bad? It doesn\u2019t happen overnight. This has been happening for decades and the incompetence of the mayors office and APD has allowed it to get this bad with no consequences for the zombies that roam the streets. How is it okay that I can drive down the road and see people getting their dick sucked by a hooker, people smoking crack, and a car get broken into all within a mile. It\u2019s fucking crazy that these people are okay with living like this.\n\nFollowing the rules of the road and driving safely seems to be fucking impossible for you people as well. How many fatal roll overs do we need to have a week before we start paying attention. I\u2019ve been hit by some idiot merging into me on I-40 and he acted like this was a normal thing for him. At least once a day I see people just blowing through red lights and forcing everyone to swerve or stop for them, and maybe twice a week I drive by a roll over. Every time traffic is backed up, all I think is, \u201calright, let\u2019s see what proud Albuquerque resident just splattered themselves across the highway\u201d. And it\u2019s always some idiot teenager trying to show off for their friends they just fucking killed. \n\nJust learn to drive, I\u2019ve never seen a city struggle so much with basic driving skills. Even the Boston drivers were better than this. How the fuck are you all terrible drivers and it\u2019s just accepted as normal. Put down the phone, go the speed limit, and stop at red lights. I didn\u2019t think this was a lot to ask until I got here\n\nI\u2019m not here by choice, I\u2019m a \u201ctRaNsPlAnT\u201d. I am only here for work and I can not wait to get the fuck out of this waste land. This city just needs to be wiped out and restarted like a failed experiment. \n\nWhy do you people let the homeless and tweakers run the god damn city? Grocery shopping here is a god damn nightmare.\n\nEvery time I have to go to smiths or target or Walmart, wherever. All I see is homeless \u201cpeople\u201d. From the moment I get out of my car I\u2019m being begged for money. Is it impossible for these zombies to get fucking clean, go to rehab and get a job, and stop being burdens to the rest of us.\n\nThey steal so much I can\u2019t even shop in peace. Once I get into the stores, these IPS rent-a-cops are always fighting with strung out tweakers and throwing them out. Then I can\u2019t even check out in peace. Somehow a tweaker makes it through the checkout line and gets to the register with no fucking money. Everyone could tell while they were in line this would happen so why don\u2019t we just throw them out and save everyone 20 minutes of fucking around at the register.\n\nJust let me buy my shit in peace, I have no money for these shells of human beings. And they manage to steal so much everything is locked up and I have to wait half an hour to get god damn laundry detergent. It\u2019s absurd that we let it get this bad, but that\u2019s not just a homeless issue. That\u2019s also an issue of these fatherless jits that run around thinking they\u2019re hot shit. Well half the time they either end up in a fatal car accident or getting domed by a 9mm because they thing gangs are cool. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s real cool bleeding to death in fucking Albuquerque of all places.\n\nLike I said, checking out requires Herculean effort. All these pressure sensors make everything twice as long because once I purchase something lighter than a gallon of milk, I need to wait for a cashier to come verify I\u2019m not stealing. That\u2019s how normalized this fucking shit is. We just adapt instead of addressing the real issue and keeping those jits and tweakers out.\n\nHope the proud Albuquerque residents who run the subreddit know that removing posts won\u2019t get rid of the problem. We need the people traveling here to know what kind of hellish landscape they\u2019re coming to.\n\nHell, half the time you can\u2019t even understand the people who live here. How do you live in a country that speaks predominantly English and you can not comprehend a fucking word. I\u2019m not saying these people who only speak Spanish are stupid I\u2019m just in awe they\u2019ve somehow made it this far in life in this country. So if you do plan on moving here or visiting make sure you are fluent in Spanish because that\u2019s all these people speak and look at you like a retard for knowing English in this country.",

    "title": "Rethinking Mending",
    "selftext": "Mending is very divisive enchantment. Some love it some hate it, some can't imagine game without  other would like it removed. \n\nI'm in the first group of course. \n\nBut that not the point. I was thinking about redoing how it works\u2026 because how the enchanting and experience works in Minecraft. \n\n\n\nBecause let's be serious paying with experience was always a ridiculous idea, that should have been dropped long ago.\n\nSo I have the idea of making experience being use only as rquirement(I described it more [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A6DyGPqRVTkN3SVa-33maEgU-q2L0oJcrIAsE0HczBU/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.wt7dk5wxgsmx))\u2026 but here comes the problem with mending. \n\nI mean mending works by paying for the repair with xp we would get otherwise. \n\nSo with removing paying with xp the mending would have to be completely redone...\n\n\n\nAnd frankly I'm not sure how to go about this. But I have some early drafts of the idea for it: \n\n**1. Time based repair**  \nEvery 200 ticks (10 seconds) all items with mending enchantment would get back 1 durability point. Items in chest would get 5 when chest would recive random tick. \n\n**2. Using lapis**  \nAs lapis is established as the magic resource in game the option is to use it for repair. The way it would work is that when we have lapis in main hand and the tool in off-hand (yes I know it would require to make fully working off-hand in bedrock, but I think we can all agree it should be done anyway) or armor enchanted with mending then using (right mouse buton clicking maybe with shift) could use 1 lapis to repair\u2026 well I'm not sure how much but let's say about 25%.\n\nIt won't necessiraly be more efficient than repairing with resources (considering in this new system repairing with resource in the anvil WON'T have any additional cost)\n\n**3. Repairing with mana**  \nBut we don't have mana you may said. And you would be right. Well some could say \"experience is mana\", but for me it's just bad take - doesn't really make much sense neither with the name nor mechanic. \n\nBut who said a new mana system couldn't be added\u2026 I know one could say \"we already have lapis\". But if we would have mana as something player can get in similar way to experience (in that case enchanted bootles could give mana... and perhaps be brew with use of lapis...) - but of course it would not be gain in the same way. I mean some actions may overlap of course (like maybe some mobs would also drop mana - but I would reserve that to those actually magical like witches, evokers and vexes). \n\nProbably there would also be various way to generate it, for example with some structures (I mean in similar maner like beacon and conduit work with some structure) - which could also increase enchanting table capabilities in their range. Actually beacon pyramid could work this way in efficiency depending on material used for it\u2026 OR if it would be made entirely from lapis. It could in each second give let's say 1 mana points per every level of the pyramid (or 1 for 1st, +2 for 2nd, +3 for 3rd etc.; perhaps Lapis pyramid could even not have a limit), effectivity could be doubled or even trippled when player stands in the beam. But I would say it should not be the only option as it would block it behind a fight what in general is not good thing. There should be some viable (though it could be less effective, but should still be reliable) way to generate it on peaceful. \n\nMana would be something player can have (there could be another bar, but displayed only in inventory on the right side, with elements looking like lapis item, where every element means 10 points, so bar with 10 lapis symbols would mean 100 mana capacity) but have limited \"capacity\". Beside for mending mana could be probably used to enchanting (with or maybe instead of lapis...) and... well I don't know. \n\nPerhaps it could be used to add some magic system that player could use to cast some spells, but I'm not sure how to go about it\u2026 (and I'm not for adding something just to be in game, I think every new feature should be well thought through... ) and it generally is another can of worms I won't necessiraly would like to go about ther\n\n**Variants:**\n\na) Instead of flat value in all cases some percentages could work instead of flat value like for example 0.1% of total durability (but not less than 1 durability point) every 10 seconds (this would mean total repair would take \\~2 hours and 46 minutes )\n\nb) With such revamp of mending it could actually have levels now, which would increase it effectivity so for example Mending I would repair 1 durability point per 1 mana points/10 seconds, but Mending V would repair by 5 points etc.  percentage values \n\n  \nI'm not saying any of these proposal is perfect, but I guess at least it's something to start with. What do You think would work best? Or maybe the best way would be some combination of them? Or maybe You have better idea for revamping mending?(with removal of paying in experience in mind)  \n\nI would like to hear your thoughts",

    "title": "I stopped trying to be  \"disciplined\" and everything changed.",
    "selftext": "Around 2 years ago I would notice my body waking up tired and fatigue. I didn't know why but it caused me to stay in bed and procrastinate even harder. I would scroll for hours in bed and still feel tired.\n\nEven after I've stopped scrolling and stayed in bed for about 2-3 hours I'd still feel extremely fatigue, I didn't know the reason why but I had some ideas.\n\nBut after 2 years of optimizing my sleep and habits I've found the answer. It was because of my sleeping habits and patterns. It wasn't because I was lazy. It was because I didn't do what was good for my body. There were days I'd sleep for about 6 hours and some 4 hours. This inconsistency caused further damaged to my sleep. Causing me to be even more tired all the time.\n\nBut I want to help you guys avoid this. So after 2 years of trial and error here's 3 things I found that worked best in optimizing energy.\n\n**1. Sleep-**\n\n**Getting enough sleep is arguably the cheat code to discipline.**\u00a0It gives you more energy which in turn makes you more productive as a person because the more energy you have the more you'll likely to do more things.\n\nSince energy plays a vital role in becoming disciplined.\n\n* More energy = Higher chances of being productive.\n* Less energy = Higher chances of being lazy.\n\nI remember when I would sleep at 12 am the next day I would feel sluggish and tired. I would always scroll first thing in the morning and waste at least 2 hours watching in YouTube.\n\nBut now I don\u2019t and I fixed it. I slept early, got more energy and actually became disciplined. I even have sometimes too much energy throughout the day that I get shocked at how much I get done.\n\nIf you have trouble fixing your sleep here's a simple framework to follow:\n\n1. Tire your body - The reason you are not able to sleep fast at night is because your body isn\u2019t tired. This means your body is not seeking rest or recovery. And when it isn\u2019t, it doesn\u2019t want to sleep. It wants to use that energy and get tired. So tire your body during the morning and you\u2019ll have an easier time to sleep. I decided to clean our house more than required. Enough to make me tired at nighttime.\n2. Schedule - You need to sleep daily and consistently everyday. This way your body clock gets regulated and fixed. You\u2019ll have to put up not being able to sleep properly for a few days but once you get this rolling it becomes easier. I found this easy to follow once you practice it over a week.\n3. No phone 1 hour before bed - Blue light causes our eyes to go dry and makes our mind stay awake. This means you need to stay away from screens near your bedtime. That way you\u2019ll have an easier time to sleep and stay on track. I always notice the difference when I would scroll before sleeping. My eyes would dry out and cause my brain to stay alert. But if I don\u2019t I can feel my eyes being sleepy helping me sleep faster.\n\nMoving on\n\n2. Diet-\n\nThe food you eat actually controls your energy systems. So if you eat junk food and sweets all the time this makes your body go into sleep mode.\u00a0**Because sugar makes you lethargic and lazy. I would always feel the difference in my body after tasting sweets. It was like my body went into sleep mode.**\n\nThis in turn made me sleep more and waste time. Forcing myself to get things done was possible but extremely hard.\n\nSo if you want to stop feeling tired all the time I suggest you eat:\n\n* Meat: Since it has a lot of protein. Because protein makes your body energetic and strong. It also contains a lot of vitamins.\n* Vegetables: This is actually good for your health too. The underlying effect of this is healthy choices. When you start to eat healthy you'll be more likely do healthier things. Like going on a workout or taking a walk which helps in lowering fatigue and tiredness\n* Fruits: These are good as replacement for sweets. Fruits naturally taste sweet like apples or mangoes. So if you crave sweets try changing it with fruits instead. Which is a healthy option.\n\n1. Go outside often and socialize.\n\nWe people are social creatures. Talking to people actually spikes our energy most of the times. It can be hanging out with friends or saying hello to strangers.\n\nThis is where the meme touch grass comes in but I actually noticed how my energy became higher every time I would take a walk. I don't know the science behind this but touching nature also made me more energetic as a person.\n\nWhen I would travel to forests or a rural area, I can feel my energy rising. So highly recommend you try and go out often if you have time.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nIf you liked this post I have a premium free\u00a0[\"Delete Procrastination Cheat Sheet\"](https://everydayimprovementletters.carrd.co/)\u00a0 template I've used to overcome my bad habits and stay consistent on making progress on my goals.

    "selftext": "Am I a bad person for only choosing to house sit for the Widow Mcormick because she is absolutely loaded and might pay me generously? Probably, but that doesn\u2019t matter. What does matter is that something bad happened while I was there, something that was my fault. It started off normal, her going with the whole,\n\u201cMake sure the cats are fed. Keep the place neat and tidy. Don\u2019t invite anyone over\u201d and she left. Mrs. Mcormick has a huge house, like a huge Victorian gothic French type of estate with rows of red roses that outline the outside. I slowly opened the door, which was more like a portal to a vampiric pocket dimension. The walls were a mauve darkish red, the floors were tiled with shiny black and white squares that clanked under my shoes sending an echo throughout the house. In front of me was a grand staircase with gold railing that had an aura that nearly beckoned me to go up it. The whole place looked like I was in a gothic adaptation of The Great Gatsby. I stood in the middle for what felt like hours, the chills of the house speckling my skin in goosebumps and the silence inducing a ringing in my ears. That\u2019s when the silence was broken.\nMaaaoooow\nI nearly jumped out of my skin, when suddenly at the top of the stairs, the small blue remaining resident of the estate emerged from the darkness. it looked at me suspiciously, but I kept my composer and began to walk throughout the house.\nI made my way to the kitchen where there was a note left on the counter for me. I picked it up,\nDearest Julian,\nThank you dearly for finding it in your heart to watch over my house and cats. You\u2019re a fine young man and I wish my dear Warren were here to meet you. Make sure the cats are feed every 4 hours and there is roast beef in the oven from a dinner with my church friends that you may eat in the meantime. I will be back on the 15th\nSincerely, Guinevere Mcormick.\nI wouldn\u2019t call myself a fine young man, but it felt nice to know that at least one person thought I was worthy of being called it. I felt a little bad for being dishonest, but that didn\u2019t really matter anymore. In the windowsill was a vase. I walked up to it and observed it further, it was an urn, no doubtingly holding Mr. Mcormick. It was red, it almost looked like a candy apple, black roses patterned its surface. Don\u2019t ask why, but I picked it up. It felt smooth against my hands as I rubbed my palms on its surface. I could hear the ashes turn inside like a sandstorm. I really wish I hadn\u2019t picked it up, honestly, I wish I\u2019d never asked to house sit. I felt something against my ankle, a strange cold hairy sensation ran up my leg causing me to flinch and jump.\nSMASH\nThe sound of breaking porcelain pierced the sound barrier and the dusty cloud that emerged from the shattered remains invaded my lungs. When I finished hacking out all the ashes, I slowly looked down. There was another feline felon that was looking up at me right next to it. It was shattered, at least 15 pieces of glossy red vase were sitting upon a grey desert which had blown across the tiled floor. I was stiff, my muscles tensed up, my pupils dilated inwards,\n\u201cNo\u2026\u201d I whispered,\n\u201cNo. No nononononoNOOO!\u201d I fell to the ground trying to pick up the thick pieces of the urn, but my hands were shaking in terror, and I kept dropping back into Mr. Mcormick and sending puffs of deathly dust to invade my nostrils and lungs as I hyperventilated. That stupid god damn cat was still staring at me, probably internally laughing that I was probably gonna be publicly executed for my sins. Thinking quickly, I shot up and raced to the broom that was in the corner of the kitchen. I grabbed the pieces of the urn and placed them on the counter and began to sweep up the remains of Mr. Mcormick. It looked like I\u2019d gotten him up off the floor, but the sleek tile floor still looked matte and dusty, so I did what I thought would be the right thing to do. I grabbed the sponge that was in the sink and began to wipe Mr. Mcormick up. I felt queasy as I scrubbed knowing I was essentially mopping up a corpse, but it was the best I could do. After I rinsed the sponge, I looked through the cabinets and found a jar where I put the ashes in. I then pulled out my phone and searched,\nRed vase with black roses\nI frantically scrolled until I found something. It was slightly darker than the first one, but nearly identical to the first urn that held Mrs. McCormick\u2019s late husband. I purchased it and hoped I could somehow repent for what I\u2019d done.\n        \tI don\u2019t know why I chose to sleep in Mrs. McCormick\u2019s room, I just did. Usually I\u2019d be falling asleep with the tv blasting whatever cop show was on, but there wasn\u2019t a tv. I was stuck in silence, stuck with my thoughts, stuck thinking about how badly I\u2019d screwed up, stuck regretting ever deciding to talk to that old widow in the cafe. I tried to rest my eyes, but I couldn\u2019t feel tired to save my life, all I could feel was guilt, but suddenly I could feel something else. My left leg felt weird. I\u2019d had leg pain, my leg fall asleep, even the occasional Charlie horse, but this weirdness was\u2026different. It felt cold, tingly, it felt like it wasn\u2019t even there. I tried to ignore it, but I just felt off, I felt cold even though I was shrouded in a satin blanket, I felt light. I kept my eyes closed, trying to fall asleep, but the feeling got stronger, my leg felt colder, more tingly, like it was being pulled off, I felt colder, lighter. That\u2019s when I couldn\u2019t bear it anymore, I shot up.\n        \tThere he was. He was standing at the end of the bed. I could see right through him, but I could see him. He wore a sleek dress shirt and pants; his face was so\u2026sorrowful. The wrinkles in his forehead, his smile lines, they made him seem so pitiful, like he needed a hug, but it was clear that if I tried to reach out and touch him, my hand would phase right through him. Now, that wasn\u2019t what made him terrifying, it was that when I looked down, his left leg was gone, like it had faded away at the knee. I knew I\u2019d messed up; I knew I\u2019d wiped part of him away. I knew it was down the drain, that he would never be whole,\n\u201cWhere---is---my leg?\u201d his voice was melancholically somber. It sounded like honey, like the sickly-sweet scent of human death,\n\u201cI\u2026I don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d I whisper,\n\u201cWhere is my leg?\u201d he kept repeating it. I couldn\u2019t run, I felt frozen. All I could do was watch as he reached his shaking hands out and pull the blanket off of me,\n\u201cCan I have yours?\u201d\n",

So I told gen spark to build this app that takes YouTube links or videos and turns them into slides or other forms of content. \n\nIt one shotted pretty much all the frontend stuff like the website and pages and dashboard etc. it basically gave prototypes. Now im kinda stuck and unsure what to do as it did give some really detailed documentation on everything. But Im trying to figure out how to take all of its prototypes and begin working on the backend and full functionality of the app with another ide like windsurf or vs. \n\nI\u2019ve downloaded all the pages as htmls and also have all the docs it generated as pdfs. \n\nI\u2019ve tried adding it all into windsurf and roo code and having it build the proper repository structure but when trying to preview and code with it it just doesn\u2019t seem to work or it\u2019ll display the website brokenly. \n\nAnd then I got sent down a long cycle of errors and bugs that the agent wasn\u2019t able to resolve.\n\nI deleted everything in hopes that I will find a good solution to start correctly again. \n\n",

    "selftext": "Asian men already have to deal with so many bad stereotypes that makes us undesirable. Asian women just adding and reinforcing the stereotypes don\u2019t help either. I understand the frustrations that you can have with Asian culture but in the western world ur voices are more heard and valued than ours. I see so many videos on TikTok and Reddit of Asian women criticizing Asian men of being misogynistic and other stuff saying how Korea and Japan is bad for women and point at declining birth rates. Talk about Korea 4b movement when it is mostly not a popular thing in Korea. Asian men are already undesirable and the few who do have interest will just be turned off hearing these horror stories that Asian women portray us as. It is beating a dead horse like we already don\u2019t have a good reputation and pushing a narrative of Asian men being a misogynist and losers just adds more to the already massive amounts of stereotypes we have. Like if u want us to change then talk to the local Asian men and have constructive conversations around it. Not bash us online and beat the dead horse that is Asian men. I wrote this here to see if my view is unreasonable and is restricting Asian women in a way that is unfair.",

I feel scared to even look at a woman in public. I don\u2019t want to interact with female coworkers because I am absolutely terrified of a rumor going around that I\u2019m a creep if I accidentally look at a woman the wrong way or something I say is misinterpreted, and then I end up losing my job and my livelihood. I always stand far away from women and even step out of the way if a woman gets close to me. I have this feeling that women are always skeptical of me and judgmental of me or develop these really untrue opinions of me before they know anything about me or who I am as a person, and it feels so scary.\u00a0\n\nI have never spoke to a woman in a sexual manner or coerced a woman or made unwanted advances or anything like that. In my heart I genuinely respect women, even though I know some might take that statement with a grain of salt. It\u2019s difficult because yes, I do want a marriage and a family someday, but I don\u2019t know how I will ever achieve that. In society the man is still the one who has to approach women, but women always talk about how wrong it is for men to approach them and how barbaric, selfish, even genocidal men are. I\u2019m more scared of women now at 30 than I was when I was a teenager. I truly don\u2019t know how to overcome this or what the solution is.\u00a0\n\nAny advice for me?\u00a0",

Oh, and let's throw in randomly driving trucks through the magic people are trying to make happen for them, again by refusing to absorb clue how things work and again just expecting the uncredited universe to furnish self-healing magic. What else? Disrespect for others' time and work, gendered language belittling accomplishment, and just lack of responsibility in general. Promises that mean nothing. Blame-shifting. Increasing sourness when called out and complaints that they can't get the work *they signed up for* done because they're too busy or have to go to the pub.\n\nOn paper, my job is great: okay pay, remote, part-time with full benefits, really good health insurance, good project, personable main boss. In practice, to make things work, my time boundaries are totally being violated, getting what I need to do my job is incredibly stressful and half the time my work just gets thrown away, and it's a hostage situation: if I shrug and say yeah it's too bad, we ran out of time for magic, it's a shame, a bunch of young people get fucked over.

Either things will get better or things will turn into such shit that jobs will be the least of our problems.

And they wanted to reclaim the UK market, unfortunately they no longer had the rights to use the breville branding in the UK as they had previously sold it to Newell Brands company, instead they chose to sell under the name of sage.\n\nTo make things even more confusing Newell Brands company also make and manufacture a line of coffee machines called the sunbeam! \n\nSooo here's how it looks simplified \n\nNewell Brands company owns both sunbeam and breville UK. \n\nBrevaille global sells in the UK under the name Sage. \n\nThe easiest way to tell the difference is the logo. BUK still use the original breville logo where the I is dotted in red. BG uses the newer logo where all text is black. \n\nI hope to have at least maby made this make a little more sence to you. \n\nIf your machine is made by Newell Brands company, so a BUK machine you are in the right subreddit, welcome! \n\nIf your machine is made by BG/sage you are in the wrong subreddit and instead need to hope on over to r/breville, sorry to see you go so soon but I'd rather you have information relative to your machine!

    "selftext": "I'll be talking about the upcoming character, so if you don't want to be spoiled on then you might not want to read any further.\n\nSo I've wanted to build freminet for quite some time now, and with escoffier being a buff to freeze teams, I've been wondering how she might synergize with freminet. I know people have mainly been playing freminet as a physical dps, but is he good with freeze comps? \n\nI've personally been thinking about running him in a team with furina, escoffier and maybe chongyun, since chongyun will give cryo infusion, atk speed and cooldown reduction (but also mainly because I've wanted an excuse to play chongyun too lol). Of course this is all speculation right now as she's not out yet, but assuming nothing about escoffier's kit changes, would this work for freminet, or does anyone think that another team would work better? I'd love to hear people's opinions because I kinda suck at teambuilding lol. \n\nPreferably I'd like to play both freminet and chongyun in the same team since I like both of them a lot, but if their kits don't synergize as well as I'm thinking they do then I'd love to know some alternatives! Thanks in advance!",

    "selftext": "I'm rewatching Season 1 right now and it's hitting me just how good the show is in terms of meaning. These are takes you all have prob heard before but just needed to share somewhere without spoiling it for my friends. Contains spoilers!\n\nFirst of all, I realized that early on in the investigation, there's all this hype going on about how the murder was somehow satanic, we need a committee to investigate anti-Christian crimes, etc. Yet, the group of abusers is directly connected to the church. This may be a nod to sex abuse scandals and the depravity in the world that happens under the guise of religiosity, but it's especially ironic to me that there's this whole boogeyman about satanists when it's actually the most powerful family that is protecting and probably perpetrating the abuse.\n\nThen there's the fact that Rust's worldview is literally pessimistic, and it takes someone like that to say ok, we are going to visit the church and keep investigating. In fact, Rust's quote about how it takes bad men to protect others from bad men is so pertinent--he's worked undercover in narcotics, drinks to numb himself, and literally sees existence as a tragic error, yet strangely is the main hero of the season. Something that hadn't hit me but my friend pointed out is that early on, Marty literally doesn't do anything to contribute to the investigation--it's as if he's just a salaryman trying to get by, and yet he recognizes that Rust is somehow, despite his strange, dark worldview, keenly interested in solving the case and getting to the bottom of the evil.\n\nIt almost feels like the show is about how surface-level degeneracy is attacked by entities like the church as a projection of their own, deeper depravity. It reminds me of Nietzsche's Genealogy of Morals--the priestly class that stands for 'purity' and becomes sickly, depraved, and dark. Man is definitely an 'interesting animal' in this show. Rust copes with the meaninglessness that the church tries to assuage with its teachings by resorting to the vices it condemns--yet the church itself causes the pain and suffering that they are selling a supposed antidote for. The setting in a broken Louisiana community makes this even more striking--it almost makes religion seem like this strange, predatory entity used by psychopaths to prey on the weak, broken people around them--and it is only because Rust has seen what he has, been where he's been, and is who he is that his nose is so apt for sniffing out the source of this depravity and solving the case. It takes a literal pessimist to find the truth about the murders.\n\nSeason 1 rules.",

    "selftext": "Recently I learned I fell for a close friend who is Aromantic. I tried desperately not develop feelings for them, despite becoming close and deeply caring for him. Everything I learned about him as we got closer only made my feelings stronger until I had no choice but to confront them.\n\nWe talked, and he isn't mad, or upset, or worried. I explained I might even consider it a strong platonic or alterous love instead of purely romantic. He tried his best to be as sensitive as possible, and treated my feelings with as much tenderness as he could. Ultimately, he told me that while he appreciated and understood what I was feeling, he doesn't care for me with the same level of intensity as I do him.\n\nAs we continued he said that the idea of a QPR (Queer-Platonic Relationship) isn't off the table, but he is *not* looking for a partner at present, and importantly he doesn't want to pursue one with me right now and \"force it\". Rather, he said that it was possible, but it would require our friendship to *mutually* develop in that direction. He said \"let's just see where the friendship goes\".\n\nI understand all of this, and I've always tried to respect his identity and put his bounderies first. I'm not even opposed to just seeing if that's where we end up. But even as hiss friend, even platonically, I love him more than anyone I've ever known.\n\nHe's always been kind to me, caring, and incredibly giving in our friendship including emotionally, but this still hurts so bad, knowing that the person I love most doesn't love me nearly as much as I love them.\n\nHow do I go forward? I don't know what to do with these feelings, or how to express them. I don't know if I should try to let them simmer down and see if we both go the way of a QPR, or just try to let him go. We've been friends for eight months now but known each other longer, and I feel like we've still only scratched the surface, and there's still opportunities to get closer.",

    "title": "AI chatbots will help neutralize the next generation",
    "selftext": "Disclaimer: I am not here to masturbate for everyone about how AI and new technology is bad like some luddite. I use it, there's probably lots of people in this sub who use it, because quite frankly it is useful and sometimes impressive in how it can help you work through ideas. I am instead wanting to open a discussion on the more general weariness I've been feeling about LLMs, their cultural implications, and how it contributes to a broader decaying of social relations via the absorption of capital.\n\nGPT vomit is now pervasive in essentially every corner of online discussion. I've noticed it growing especially over the last year or so. Some people copy-paste directly, some people pretend they aren't using it at all. Some people are literally just bots. But the greatest amount of people I think are using it behind the scenes. What bothers me about this is not the idea that there are droolers out there who are fundamentally obstinate and in some Sisyphian pursuit of reaffirming their existing biases. That has always been and will always be the case. What bothers me is the fact that there seems to be an increasingly widespread, often subconscious, deference to AI bots as a source of legitimate authority. Ironically I think Big Tech, through desperate attempts to retain investor confidence in its massive AI over-investments, has been shoving it in our face enough to where people start to question what it spits out less and less. \n\nThe anti-intellectual concerns write themselves. These bots will confidently argue any position, no matter how incoherent or unsound, with complete eloquence. What's more, its lengthy drivel is often much harder (or more tiring) to dissect with how effectively it weaves in and weaponizes half-truths and vagueness. But the layman using it probably doesn't really think of it that way. To most people, it's generally reliable because it's understood to be a fluid composition of endless information and data. Sure, they might be apathetic to the fact that the bot is above all invested in providing a satisfying result to its user, but ultimately its arguments *are* crafted from someone, somewhere, who once wrote about the same or similar things. So what's really the problem?\n\nThe real danger I think lies in the way this contributes to an already severe and worsening culture of incuriosity. AI bots don't think because they don't feel, they don't have bodies, they don't have a spiritual sense of the world; but they're trained on the data of those who do, and are tasked with disseminating a version of what thinking *looks like* to consumers who have less and less of a reason to do it themselves. So the more people form relationships with these chatbots, the less of their understanding of the world will be grounded in lived experience, personal or otherwise, and the more they internalize this disembodied, decontextualized version of knowledge, the less equipped they are to critically assess the material realities of their own lives. The very practice of making sense of the world has been outsourced to machines that have no stakes in it.\n\nI think this is especially dire in how it contributes to an already deeply contaminated information era. It's more acceptable than ever to observe the world through a post-meaning, post-truth lens, and create a comfortable reality by just speaking and repeating things until they're true. People have an intuitive understanding that they live in an unjust society that doesn't represent their interests, that their politics are captured by moneyed interests. We're more isolated, more obsessive, and much of how we perceive the world is ultimately shaped by the authority of ultra-sensational, addictive algorithms that get to both predict and decide what we want to see. So it doesn't really *matter* to a lot of people where reality ends and hyperreality begins. This is just a new layer of that - but a serious one, because it is now dictating not only what we see and engage with, but unloading *how we internalize it* into the hands of yet another algorithm.",

    "selftext": "Me (19M) and my girlfriend (18F) have been dating for a little over 2 months. Things are good overall, but there's this one thing that\u2019s been messing with me since the start and I honestly need to let it out and see if I\u2019m overreacting or not.\n\nSo back in the first or second week of dating, I made a dumb mistake. I asked her something I now realize was super immature: I asked how big her ex was. Not my proudest moment at all. Her and her ex dated for 4 years, and yeah, I guess I was insecure and curious. She\u2019s 18 now, so they started dating when she was around 14 and broke up not too long ago. She also didn't have intercourse, and I took her v card\u2014so all of her knowledge about her ex\u2019s size would\u2019ve been just from seeing it, not during sex.\n\nAnyway, when I asked her, she kinda giggled and said \u201cAre you sure you want to know?\u201d and I was like yeah, just tell me. She goes, \u201cHe was bigger.\u201d\n\nAt the time, I just let it slide. I thought it wouldn\u2019t affect me much, but man... I was wrong. For two months, it sat in the back of my mind and just grew. I kept overthinking it, comparing, questioning why she said it like that, and wondering if she really preferred him or still had feelings. It seriously messed with my confidence, even though I tried to pretend it didn\u2019t.\n\nNow for context: I had told her my size early on\u2014around 7 to 7.5 inches. But mine varies a lot (like honestly, it can go up to 8 depending on the situation). She said her ex was \u201ccloser to 8\u201d which, again, felt like an unnecessary flex when I hadn\u2019t even pushed for that much detail. And I started thinking, \u201cWait a minute\u2014if you\u2019ve seen both mine and his, and mine can literally reach 8 too, how are you so confident he\u2019s bigger?\u201d\n\nSo two months later, I finally brought it up. I told her how that comment had stuck with me and made me feel insecure. The convo got kind of argument-ish, not full-blown yelling but definitely tense. I told her, \u201cYou said he was bigger, and I believed you, but thinking about it now... I\u2019m not even sure that\u2019s true. If anything, mine might actually be bigger or about the same, but you didn\u2019t say that\u2014you made it sound like I was just smaller.\u201d\n\nHer response? She kinda started defending it again, like saying, \u201cSo what if he was?\u201d and stuff like that. That made me feel worse. Like instead of comforting me or just saying \u201cI didn\u2019t mean it like that,\u201d she almost seemed like she was justifying him. I started getting frustrated and told her, \u201cIf you\u2019ve seen both of us, why wouldn\u2019t you just say that we\u2019re the same or mine is bigger? My measurements are real, but your eyes should\u2019ve confirmed that even without me telling you the numbers.\u201d\n\nEventually I said, \u201cYou can\u2019t even seem to remember his size properly, so I\u2019m starting to think mine might actually be bigger.\u201d And then she suddenly goes, \u201cYeah yours is bigger.\u201d And I was like, \u201cReally? You\u2019re just saying that now after this whole conversation and after seeing how upset I am.\u201d She goes, \u201cWallah I don\u2019t think that way. I know yours is bigger if anything, since it ranges and stuff.\u201d\n\n(For anyone who doesn\u2019t know\u2014Wallah is like a huge promise in Arabic, something we both take super seriously, so hearing her say that hit different.)\n\nI wanted to believe her, but I still felt weird. A few days later, we met up and I brought it up again. I asked, \u201cWhy did you lie? You knew this would affect me\u2014any guy would be bothered by that kind of answer.\u201d And she told me that she thought I was just being curious when I first asked and that I seemed chill about it, so she didn\u2019t think it was a big deal. She told me that from the very beginning, she knew mine was bigger, but didn\u2019t think she needed to say it because I was acting like it didn\u2019t matter to me.\n\nThen I asked, \u201cOkay, but why didn\u2019t you just say that when we were arguing?\u201d And she straight up said, \u201cI found it entertaining.\u201d\n\nWhich was... weird. Not gonna lie. That part just confused me more than anything. Like, why would seeing me get in my own head about something so sensitive be entertaining?\n\nThen there\u2019s one more layer to all of this. When we first started talking, before we even officially dated, I had lied to her about my body count. I told her it was 1, when it was actually 3. The only reason I lied was because I asked her, \u201cWhat would you do if I had more than one?\u201d and she told me flat out she\u2019d break up with me. So I panicked and lied. I came clean during the first week of our relationship and told her the full truth, and I really regretted lying in the first place.\n\nShe ended up bringing that lie into this and said she wanted me to feel the same pain she felt when I lied to her about that. So she lied to me back\u2014about something she knew would hit my insecurity. Just to even the score, basically.\n\nAnd look\u2014I know I\u2019m the one who opened the door to this convo by asking a dumb question in the first place. But I\u2019ve been stuck on this ever since. I still overthink. I believe her now when she says mine is bigger, but I keep replaying how she said her ex was bigger so casually, how she let me think that for two months, how she only corrected it after I got upset, and how she justified it by saying it was for \u201centertainment\u201d and \u201crevenge\u201d for my earlier lie.\n\nSo yeah. Am I crazy for still feeling weird about all this? Or is this one of those things I just have to move past if I want to make the relationship work?\n\nThere\u2019s probably even more context I didn\u2019t include, so if anything\u2019s unclear or you need more details, just let me know and I\u2019ll explain. I just needed to get this off my chest.\n\n**TL;DR:**  \nI (19M) asked my gf (18F) early on how big her ex was (they dated for 4 years), and she said he was bigger. I brushed it off at first but ended up overthinking it for two months. She never had intercourse and I took her v card, so her comparison was just based on sight. I brought up how it made me feel insecure, and after a long conversation, she swore (Wallah) mine was actually bigger but said she lied for three reasons: (1) she thought I didn\u2019t care at the time, (2) she found it \u201centertaining,\u201d and (3) she wanted to make me feel the same pain I caused her when I lied about my body count early on. I still feel weird about it all. Am I being too sensitive?",
